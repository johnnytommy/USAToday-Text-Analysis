Climate change still real despite cold; We will see cold waves in the future, even as the planet warms


It happens every winter.
Sometime between Santa's squeeze down the chimney and the groundhog's peek out of his hole, a cold snap or big snowstorm gives climate-change skeptics another chance to suggest that global warming isn't happening.
Some examples this week: Radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh said the "polar vortex" the cold was blamed on is a new term invented by the media to link the cold wave to man-made climate change. The term has been around for decades.
Donald Trump took to Twitter to write: "Record snowfall & freezing temps throughout the country. Where is Global Warming when you need it?!"
So if it's very cold, then global warming isn't real? Scientists say no: "This week's brutal cold wave was a 1-in-20-year type of event," says meteorologist Jeff Masters of the Weather Underground, "and we will continue to see such cold waves in the future, even as the planet warms."
Meteorologist Cliff Mass of the University of Washington agrees, writing on his blog: "This individual event says nothing about the impacts of global warming. Global warming will occur over the coming century. ... One event proves nothing. Furthermore, the real warming is in the future."
This short blast of cold remains a blip in an onslaught of warm records: In the past four years, the USA has set more than 90,000 record high temperatures and about 38,000 record low temperatures, according to data from the National Climatic Data Center.
Additionally, in the past 40  years, winters have steadily gotten warmer (by about 0.61 degree per decade) over the contiguous USA, the climate center reports.
Globally, the decade of the 2000s was the warmest since record-keeping began in the 1880s.
Although it was very cold over parts of North America this week, it was unusually warm elsewhere: Australia is smashing heat records, with temperatures reaching 118 degrees, according to meteorologist Bob Henson, a science writer at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
Henson also says many Eurasian cities are seeing  temperatures well above average this week.
Moscow temperatures will reach the 30s and Warsaw is expecting 40s.

Weakened polar vortex causes America to snap


Mark Fischetti, Scientific American:  "Temperatures across half the U.S. are plummeting like a rock. ... So what is this mysterious marvel and why is it invading America? The polar vortex is a prevailing wind pattern that ... normally keeps extremely cold air bottled up toward the North Pole. Occasionally, though, the vortex weakens, allowing the cold air to pour down across Canada into the U.S. ... In addition to bringing cold, the air mass can push the jet stream ... that typically flows from the Pacific Ocean across the U.S.  much farther south as well."
John Hayward, Breitbart: "It's not surprising to see the Church of Global Warming in full-on shrieking panic mode, screaming at the top of their lungs that a blast of cold weather doesn't disprove their theories. Well, no, of course it doesn't. A mountain of scientific data compiled over decades disproves their theories. Nobody has to point to today's weather to demonstrate that global warming is a fraud. Actual scientists have already done that, using years of climate observations that do not ... match up with the climate models that cost the industrialized world billions of dollars."
Bryan Walsh, Time: "Not only does the cold spell not disprove climate change, it may well be that global warming could be making the occasional bout of extreme cold weather in the U.S. even more likely. ... Global warming is sometimes thought of more as 'global weirding,' with all manner of complex disruptions occurring over time. This week's events show that climate change is almost certainly screwing with weather patterns in ways that go beyond mere increases in temperature."
Larry O'Hanlon, Discovery News:  "While some non-scientists and lobbyists argue the cold waves disprove tomes of peer-reviewed science on global warming, the scientists themselves are not suggesting this at all -- although they have a range of opinions on the cause of the events. On one hand, some researchers put it down to dumb luck. ... On the other hand, there have already been connections found between Arctic warming changes in the northern jet stream, which cause weather patterns to slow and increase the changes of heat waves and droughts. Perhaps the dramatic warming of the Arctic is changing the wintertime behavior of the polar vortex as well."
Brett Snyder, The Cranky Flier: "It's not uncommon for a big winter storm to mess with travel plans, but this past week can best be described as a convergence of suck.  ... It's usually snow that causes problems, but we ran into some trouble with the significant cold snap that followed the snow this week. Of course, the people in Minneapolis are used to dealing with cold, but the cold air penetrated so far south that it impacted places that don't normally worry."
Barbara Peterson, Cond� Nast Traveler:  "JetBlue has taken the unusual step of virtually shutting down its operations at four major northeast airports. ... JetBlue said it was taking the pre-emptive step to sort out the travel mess that began with the snowstorm and deep freeze over the weekend.  ... But there's more to the story that's been drowned out by the coverage of the ultra deep freeze -- another event that took place over the weekend: The Federal Aviation Administration finally formalized new rules that require pilots to get adequate rest between flights. Which is, of course, a good thing for air safety." 




Warming warning: El Nios could get kicked into high gear; More extreme weather possible, new study says


Some of the worst El Nios, the infamous climate patterns that shake up weather around the world, could double in frequency in upcoming decades due to global warming, says  a new study out  Sunday in the journal Nature Climate Change.
During an El Nio, water temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean tend to be warmer than average for an extended period of time -- typically at least three to five months. This warm water brings about significant  changes in global weather patterns.
The most powerful El Nios  are forecast to occur once every 10 years throughout the rest of this century, according to the study's lead author, Wenju Cai of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Australia's national science agency.
Over the past 100 years or so, however these "extreme" El Nios occurred only once every 20 years, he said.
This means that the extreme weather events fueled by El Nios -- such as droughts and wildfires in Australia, floods in South America and powerful rainstorms along the U.S. West Coast -- will occur more often.
The most recent El Nio ended in 2010.
The research results came from an aggregation of 20 climate models, which were used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. The models found that this doubling of extreme El Nio episodes is caused by increased surface warming of the eastern equatorial Cai acknowledges those findings stand in contrast to previous studies that found no solid consensus on how El Nios will change because of global warming.
"The question of how global warming will change the frequency of extreme El Nio events has challenged scientists for more than 20 years," said study co-author Mike McPhaden of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. "This research is the first comprehensive examination of the issue to produce robust and convincing results."
"It looks like a solid study," said meteorologist Michael Mann of Penn State University, who was not involved in the research. "The authors appear to provide reasonably convincing evidence that El Nio events are likely to become more extreme as the climate continues to warm, in turn implying greater future regional climate/weather extremes than past studies.
However, another expert, senior scientist Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.,  said some aspects of the study are not really new, although cast in a new way.
He noted that there remain issues in how well models simulate El Nio events, which means uncertainty remains on just how El Nio and the climate of the tropical Pacific will actually change.
"Even if the projection for this increased frequency of extreme El Nios is correct, there will still be extended periods of infrequent and weak El Nios, such as has been experienced since the late 1990s (since the last big event of 1997-98)," said Lisa Goddard, director of the International Research Institute for Climate and Society at Columbia University.
A separate study published in Nature Climate Change in 2013 found that El Nios appeared to occur a lot more than normal over the last 50 years, just as temperatures worldwide rose because of global warming, also suggesting a connection. 



This winter's multiple extreme cold outbreaks are a stark reminder that global warming activists have routinely and brazenly exaggerated the effects of global warming. Each new, historic cold snap provides yet another scientific reason to doubt dire predictions about human-caused warming.
Low temperature records are falling by the hundreds this winter. This is occurring despite the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicting that extreme cold outbreaks will become less frequent and less severe. When a theory's predictions are contradicted by real-world events, sound science requires us to re-examine the theory.
Increasing the atmosphere's carbon dioxide content from three parts per 10,000 (0.03%) to four parts per 10,000 (0.04%)  should cause some modest global warming. However, the extremely cold winter reminds us this modest warming is not creating the worldwide climate catastrophe predicted by global warming activists. It also provides appropriate context for the next time we experience a heat wave and activists tell us global warming is to blame.
To the extent global warming may eventually lessen the frequency and severity of extreme cold outbreaks, it will benefit, rather than harm, human health and welfare. Mortality statistics show far more people die as a result of low temperatures and cold-associated ailments such as pneumonia and the flu than from hot temperatures and heat-associated ailments.
Many additional benefits are becoming evident as the Earth continues its gradual recovery from the Little Ice Age, which afflicted humanity from approximately 1300 to 1900. Hurricane activity is at historic lows, tornadoes are weakening, and droughts are becoming less frequent and severe.
Cold spells, heat waves and extreme weather events will continue to occur as our planet modestly warms. This winter's extreme cold outbreaks illustrate that global warming is not changing our planet's climate severely, as activists claim. To the extent changes are occurring, these are benefiting rather than harming human health and welfare.
James M. Taylor is senior fellow for environment policy at The Heartland Institute, a Chicago think tank that promotes free-market policies. 

 is one thing that is a fact: Petroleum is a finite resource. At some point, it will become scarce.  We might as well get off of it under our terms, rather than the terms imposed by the constraints of geology.
Dan Beers
The hot debate over whether the climate is warming or not  misses the point. The issue is whether humans are causing it or is it a natural cycle based on a cause we haven't identified or are ignoring. Just like when the stock market goes up or down, someone always credits a co-occurring event for the change, but that doesn't mean that event caused it.
Brent Naseath
Actually, scientists are well aware of an apparent slowdown in the rate of increase of global temperatures and do acknowledge it.
The key thing to take home is that even though the warming has slowed for now, it hasn't stopped, and it will continue.
Randy Miller
It has been hotter and colder in the past. Weather is and always will be cyclical.
Dwayne Landry
Global warming is a fact. The naysayers take isolated exceptions and try to spin them into something else.
How can anyone look at what is happening to our planet and not believe we have a problem?
Thomas Carper
Many skeptics point to cold weather in one small region of the planet to cast doubt on the climate of the entire planet.
Go look at the recent temperature records in Alaska. They're setting record high temps. Look at our West Coast. California has had no winter this year. Go look at the  heat wave taking place in Australia!
Rob Honeycutt
Whatever we might do in this country in response to alleged global warming will ultimately be trivial in the scheme of things.
If man-made carbon emissions are truly the problem, improvement efforts by the United States are overwhelmed by the Chinese,  Indians, Pakistanis, Eastern Europeans and others.
Sure, we can make the effort, but our best will have minimal impact.

I read with interest your editorial debate on climate change.  I always look at the credentials and affiliations of the writer, which in the case of the opposing view are from an organization that promotes "free-market solutions to social and economic problems." That translates to supporting corporate interests that advocate deregulation and lobbying against restrictive policies that may protect citizens, the public health and our environment ("Arctic outbreaks defy predictions," Friday).
Climate change is a global crisis that requires the expertise of real scientists and enlightened world leaders to educate and create policies that change human behavior. It also requires an educated and engaged citizenry to spur grass-roots activism when governments fail to act.
The opposing view writer is certainly entitled to his opinion, but he is not a climate scientist and seems to have a vested interest in promoting corporate and big monied interests. Follow the money.

Report: Natural gas vehicles may hurt climate; Infrastructure leaks more methane, says scientific study


Natural gas is widely hailed as cleaner than other fossil fuels, but new research says using it -- instead of diesel -- to power trucks and buses could actually exacerbate global warming over a 100-year period.
Diesel engines are relatively fuel-efficient, while the natural gas infrastructure  leaks more heat-trapping methane than federal or industry data suggest, says a study by 16 scientists from federal laboratories and seven universities including Stanford, Harvard and MIT.
"There's lots of reasons to shift from diesel," says lead author Adam Brandt of Stanford, adding diesel buses are "stinky" and natural gas ones may help cut oil imports and improve air quality. But from a climate perspective, "it's not likely to reduce greenhouse gas emissions." Burning natural gas emits less carbon dioxide than burning diesel, but the drilling and production of natural gas leaks methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Those leaks offset natural gas' CO2 benefit.
"Even running passenger cars on natural gas instead of gasoline is probably on the borderline in terms of climate," he says. His research, a review of 200-plus studies, appears in the newest edition  of the journal Science.
An industry group disagrees. Richard Kolodziej, president of Natural Gas Vehicles for America, says a 2007 report by the California Energy Commission calculated that on a well-to-wheel basis -- which includes extraction and distribution --  natural gas in vehicles emits 22% fewer greenhouse gases than diesel and 29% fewer than conventional gasoline.
Brandt says his analysis is based on greenhouse-gas calculations from a 2012 study led by Ramon Alvarez of the Environmental Defense Fund, a private research group. Alvarez's team said switching buses and trucks from diesel to natural gas might not help the climate over a 100-year period if 1.7% or more of methane is leaked in producing and using natural gas. The Environmental Protection Agency says 1.5% is leaked, an estimate Brandt says is about 50% too low.
The new research  says natural gas is still -- despite methane leaks -- better for the climate long-term than coal as a way to generate electricity.
The production of natural gas is booming in the United States, and President Obama welcomed it in his 2014 State of the Union Address as "bridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution that causes climate change."
The authors call on the natural gas industry to clean up its leaks. Fortunately for gas companies, they say a few leaks probably account for much of the problem, so repairs are doable. An earlier study of about 75,000 components at processing plants found just 50 faulty ones were behind nearly 60% of the leaked gas. 




High court could put brake on greenhouse gas rules; Case concerns extent of EPA's regulation of emission sources


The Supreme Court will weigh in Monday on one of the most intractable issues of our time: global warming.
To hear environmentalists tell it, the health and welfare of Americans will be jeopardized unless the government can continue to combat climate change by regulating greenhouse gas emissions from all sources.
To hear industry and state government opponents of  regulations tell it, billions of dollars and thousands of jobs are threatened as a result of a power grab by the Obama administration.
In truth, both sides may be exaggerating. The  court isn't questioning the danger of greenhouse gases or the government's first effort to suppress them via tailpipe emissions. The battle pits President Obama's environmental agenda against its fiercest critics in a case that could limit the Environmental Protection Agency's options as it seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, industries and other stationary sources.
"It could literally stop the ongoing regulatory thrust of the EPA in its tracks," says Richard Faulk, an environmental law expert at Hollingsworth and George Mason University School of Law.
The case is a sequel to those decided by the high court in 2007 and 2011 -- cases that affirmed the government's authority to regulate greenhouse gases from motor vehicles under the 1970 Clean Air Act. For that reason, "even a narrow victory for industry would be an important victory," says Jacob Hollinger, a former EPA lawyer now at McDermott, Will & Emery.
Industries, some  conservative states, GOP lawmakers and others claim the law doesn't empower the administration to regulate emissions from power plants and other stationary sources.
They also take issue with the EPA changing a rule in the law: Unlike other air pollutants, carbon dioxide emissions  are so ubiquitous that the EPA raised the law's threshold level requiring a permit from 100 tons per year to at least 75,000 tons. Opponents say that amounts to rewriting an act of Congress -- even though the higher threshold makes it easier for some to avoid the permit requirement -- and the EPA has no authority to do it.
The administration,  environmental groups and a number of other states including California and New York, say the Clean Air Act was meant to address all air pollutants, including greenhouse gases. Once the administration addressed auto and truck emissions, they argue, the next natural step was stationary sources.
The greenhouse gas case raises several important issues that could have repercussions, depending on the court's ruling.
First, how much authority does an agency have to change the letter (and in this case numbers) of a federal law?
Second, will the Obama administration be able to substitute air pollution permit programs for its failed "cap and trade" effort in 2010 to set an overall ceiling on greenhouse gas emissions?
Third, will the justices see this case as part of a pattern of executive branch excess, similar to the current Supreme Court battle over Obama's "recess appointments"  without Senate confirmation? If so, an industry victory could have greater political than legal implications.
"Politics matters," says Richard Lazarus, an environmental law professor at Harvard Law School. "There will be people who will take this as a rebuke." 



President Obama ordered new fuel-efficiency and carbon emissions standards for trucks, which make up about 25% of greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector.
energy mandates
It's hard to think of a president who has done more than Obama when taking on the issue of pollution and global warming.
We all know the GOP is against regulation of the energy industry, and that's why Obama is having to use his executive powers. If you listened to many GOP politicians, you would think global warming is a myth, but we must take this issue seriously. Keep it up, Mr. President!
Ricardo Rivera
Private industry has been working toward better fuel efficiency for some time.
What will happen now as a result of this mandate is that unreasonable timetables and regulations will cause a spike in the transportation costs we consumers will pay in the end.
Steve Larsen
Better fuel economy means lower carbon dioxide emissions, which is a good thing by any measure. It's way past time we started acting on what is shaping up as a big problem down the road.
Don Parent
Dirty byproducts
Natural gas puts fewer emissions in the air (improving air quality), but drilling for it will release methane, another powerful greenhouse gas.
Does anyone believe that we are going to decrease the amount of drilling for natural gas, regardless of how it is used? What about using natural gas to fuel automobiles, including taxis, UPS, FedEx and personal vehicles? How would that affect the methane issue?
J Maynard Thomas
Could I make a strong suggestion to our government? Over the past decade, we've made expensive efforts to supplement gas with ethanol, only to find that it has unintended consequences. We might have been better off sticking with gas.
We've also invested a fortune in turning to natural gas to help clean up our environment, only to now discover that it also harms the environment.
Am I the only guy out here who thinks that we need to step back and stop our knee-jerk reactions to saving the environment? Why don't we very carefully study the problem, study all our options first, and then implement the right strategy after we are sure that it won't do more damage than doing nothing? This nonsense is making me lose what little faith I once had in big government.
Ron McCallister
One thing seems to be a sure bet when it comes to burning any sort of fuel: There are waste products. No free lunch. If we burn it, it will leave other forms of pollutants.
Greg Bailey
Don't worry, be happy! Eat, drink and drill, baby, drill! It's the grandkids and generations after who will be left with the mess. So  what does it matter?
In the end, once man has trashed the Earth, it will shake what is left of us off like water off a wet dog and then start over again. The Earth abides, but not necessarily with us.
Steve Evets
Alternative energy
Oil production is only part of the story. You would have to build more refineries to keep up with demand in order to quench our thirst for gasoline, diesel and home heating oil.
The problem with satisfying that demand is that the total amount of fossil fuel available is finite. It will run out some day. We really need to be focusing on alternate energy sources for our future.
William G. Lindemann
Nuclear to power the electricity for cars and more is the best alternative to finite fossil fuels.
Philip Wilson

With the high cost of diesel fuel, don't you think the truck industry would have already done all that is feasible to increase truck mileage?
This administration doesn't seem to understand you can't legislate the laws of physics! They did this with cars, which resulted in automakers giving us tiny underpowered vehicles.
I don't think it will be so simple with trucks! But politically, it surely sounds good.

Supreme Court skeptical of greenhouse gas permits; Justices may block requirement for emissions sources


The Supreme Court appeared headed Monday toward restricting the federal government's authority to require permits for major emitters of greenhouse gases, but it remained a close call.
Such a ruling from the court's conservative wing wouldn't affect an effort by the Obama administration to regulate the sources of global warming, but it would eliminate one method of doing so.
At issue is the Environmental Protection Agency's decision to change the threshold in the Clean Air Act for the amount of emissions from a power plant, refinery or other stationary source that requires a permit. Liberal justices said it was a reasonable move to avoid an absurd overregulation of greenhouse gas emissions, but conservatives said it went too far.
"I couldn't find a single precedent that strongly supports your position," Justice Anthony Kennedy, the likely swing vote, told Solicitor General Donald Verrilli.
Kennedy was in the majority when the court ruled 5-4 in 2007 that greenhouse gases are an air pollutant and the EPA can regulate their emissions from motor vehicles. If he switches sides on whether that extends to stationary sources such as power plants, it could seal the program's fate.
The case focuses on what Verrilli called "an urgent environmental problem ... one that gets worse with the passage of time." But the court's ruling is likely to have only limited impact. The government has other ways of regulating greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources.
Industry and state government opponents of the regulations argued that permitting programs used for common air pollutants should not apply to greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, which are emitted in much greater quantities but have limited impact on local air quality.
Peter Keisler, the attorney for a coalition of industry groups, called the permitting program run by more than 90 state and local authorities a form of "command and control."
However, even the opponents didn't question the danger of greenhouse gases or the government's first effort to suppress them via tailpipe emissions. Those are matters of settled law.
Unlike other air pollutants, carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming are so ubiquitous that the EPA raised the law's threshold level requiring a permit from 100 tons per year to at least 75,000 tons.
The EPA's decision to raise the emissions level was needed to avoid requiring permits from about 80,000 midsize businesses, hospitals, universities, apartment buildings and shopping malls. Opponents say the agency rewrote an act of Congress, albeit to ease the burden on industry.
Several liberal justices said the EPA's decision made sense, because Congress didn't anticipate the problem of global warming when it passed the Clean Air Act.
"Statutes all the time have implicit exceptions," Justice Stephen Breyer said. "That's the most common thing in law." 




Should mayors rule the world?; Given Washington's gridlock, it's not a bad idea. But cities won't replace nation states.


A popular meme making the rounds in foreign policy circles goes: What if mayors ruled the world? It is also the title of political theorist Benjamin Barber's latest book, a dissection of nations' inability to tackle large problems such as climate change, and a prescription to turn instead to municipal governments to get stuff done.
Michael Bloomberg has sung a similar cities-are-the-future tune since leaving office in New York. "Mayors are pragmatists, not partisans; innovators, not ideologues," he wrote last year in an editorial. Indeed, the paralysis of Washington and the United Nations has spawned a whole cottage industry of Davos-tested ideas on how to bypass the gridlock of national legislatures and get things done. Think Arizona Sen. John McCain's "League of Democracies" idea from 2007. Barber proposes a kind of global "parliament of mayors."
These ideas might come off as hokey or utopian. To be sure, neologisms such as "glocalism" are nauseating. But let's face it: Nations have grown too large and unwieldy, and cities just might be better at solving tough problems because of their decentralized structures and indifference to sovereign borders.
Innovation, as German sociologist Max Weber pointed out, does not come naturally for large organizations. And national governments are no different.
Freedom to experiment
Mayors oversee a growingly diverse mosaic -- roughly half of the world's population now reside in cities -- which presents challenges but also allows for some degree of do-it-yourself experimentation. The result is zippy bus-rapid transit systems in Guangzhou, China, and nifty bike-sharing programs in places such as New York.
Cities also tend to be less divided  places than nations, which gives mayors more flexibility to experiment with bolder ideas with less fear of being voted out of office. But will cities replace the nation state? Are mayors really going to tackle issues such as climate change when they have potholes to worry about? What's more, there is a big divide between, say, Copenhagen, Denmark, and Lagos, Nigeria.
As more people flock to cities, crime and overcrowded slums could present a more accurate picture than the gated communities of creative types that Bloomberg and others idealize. Indeed, rapid urbanization might foretell a grimmer story, writes military expert David Kilcullen, one where violence is not eradicated but moved from mountainside redoubts to inner-city slums, or what he calls "feral cities."
Nor are mayors the godsend that Bloomberg makes them out to be. For every Cory Booker of Newark or Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, there is a Rob Ford of Toronto or a Ray Nagin of New Orleans. Mayors can be idiosyncratic, even authoritarian, micromanagers. A case in point is the former mayor of Istanbul and now prime minister of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose interference with the minutia of city planning continually riles up citizens. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was mayor of Tehran before becoming president of Iran in 2005.
Tame urban hoopla
There is also something of a teleological aspect to all this urbanization hoopla, one that suggests that man was put on this planet to shop at Whole Foods. "We are living our metropolitan destiny," Barber writes. Maybe. But tell that to the bumpkins on the other half of the planet who till the land and prefer nature to urban noise.
Try watching Werner Herzog's documentary Happy People about hunters living on the Siberian taiga, and tell me that urban life trumps life off-the-grid.
That said, cities are poised to do things better than nations. Because most cities outside of Minnesota do not share borders, they generally do not get into spats over territory. Cities also allow for a more streamlined form of civic participation, empowering the individual at the expense of the multinational. For Congress or the U.N., there is no equivalent to dialing 311 for non-emergency services. In that way, cities are a democratizing force. A central reason that the city states of the Hanseatic League gave way to nations in the 17th century, writes Hendrik Spruyt, was their inability to reduce transaction costs for the merchant class. But the reverse is arguably the case today: Nations are too gridlocked, and it's hurting business.
Cities are also bellwethers of social change. It took New York to prohibit smoking in bars before bans became common practice in Europe's cosmopolitan bistros. Maybe those who think that Bloomberg will run for president should think again. It might one day be considered a rung down the ladder from mayor.

Demystifying climate change; In report, scientists answer some of the top questions


Climate change is often called a "defining" issue of our time but  can be difficult to understand. On Thursday, two of the world's leading scientific groups released a reader-friendly guide.
This primer explains why, despite a cold winter in parts of the United States, scientists are so sure that man-made global warming is worsening, and how that's melting Arctic sea ice, raising sea levels and acidifying the oceans.
"There will always be cold nights and cold days ... but they'll become rarer," co-author Inez Fung of the University of California-Berkeley said at a Washington, D.C., forum. She also said a warmer, moister atmosphere provides more energy for storms and severe weather events.
"Actions today have long-term consequences," Fung said. Even if heat-trapping carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels  suddenly stop, she said it will take thousands of years for the Earth to cool to pre-industrial levels.
Co-author Eric Wolff of the University of Cambridge said the planet's climate has changed throughout history, but now it's changing 10 times faster, making adaptation more challenging. He said most of the warming (1.4 degrees Fahrenheit) since 1900 has occurred since the mid-1970s.
Climate Change: Evidence and Causes  is written by a dozen climate scientists on behalf of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, a private independent group, and the Royal Society, the national scientific academy of the United Kingdom. It explains what scientists know and what they're still learning.
The authors say carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations are now higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years, and unless carbon emissions are curbed, the planet could warm 4.7 to 8.6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100. They answer 20 key questions, some of  which are excerpted below:
How do scientists know that recent climate change is largely caused by human activities? Direct measurements of CO2 in the atmosphere and in air trapped in ice show that atmospheric CO2 increased by about 40% from 1800 to 2012. Measurements of different forms of carbon reveal that this increase is because of human activities.
Does the recent slowdown of warming mean that climate change is no longer happening? No. Since the very warm year 1998 that followed the strong 1997-98 El Ni�o,  the increase in average surface temperature has slowed relative to the previous decade. Despite that,  the 2000s were warmer than the 1990s. A short-term slowdown in the warming of Earth's surface does not invalidate our understanding of long-term changes in global temperature.
If the world is warming, why are some winters and summers still very cold? Global warming is a long-term trend, but that does not mean that every year will be warmer than the previous one. Day-to-day and year-to-year changes in weather patterns will continue to produce some unusually cold days and nights, and winters and summers, even as the climate warms.
Why is Arctic sea ice decreasing while Antarctic sea ice is not? Sea ice extent is affected by winds and ocean currents as well as temperature. Sea ice in the partly enclosed Arctic Ocean seems to be responding directly to warming, while changes in winds and in the ocean seem to be dominating the patterns of climate and sea ice change in the ocean around Antarctica. 




Climate change fueled Genghis Khan's rise; Mongolian rains grew lots of grassy horse feed


Throughout human history, natural climate change has played a role in the rise and fall of civilizations around the world, from the Mayans to the Romans.
The empire of Genghis Khan of Mongolia, one of the most notorious characters in world history, was helped by a dramatic rise in rainfall and mild temperatures in central Asia in the early 13th century, according to a study released Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Led by Genghis Khan and his sons and grandsons, the Mongols ruled most of modern-day Russia, China, Korea, Southeast Asia, Persia, India, the Middle East and Eastern Europe, forming the largest land empire in world history.
Previous research had speculated that the Mongols were escaping extreme drought, but this research takes the opposite tack.
Scientists led by physical geographer Amy Hessl of West Virginia University and Neil Peder-son of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory believe that the rise of Khan and the start of his sprawling empire was propelled by a temporary run of nice weather.
How did the additional rain and unusually mild weather help Khan? Horsepower, Hessl said. The abundant grasses provided the fuel for the horses that helped the Mongols and their superb cavalry conquer vast lands. It also helped provide food in the way of livestock fed by the bounty.
"Where it's arid, unusual moisture creates unusual plant productivity, and that translates into horsepower," she said. "Genghis was literally able to ride that wave."
Khan's rise to power was in 1211 to 1225 A.D. During that time, scientists found that Mongolia saw sustained rainfall and mild warmth never seen before or since. Khan and his crew didn't carry rain gauges or thermometers as they marauded over the steppes, so scientists used paleoclimatic "proxy" data --  rings from dead pine trees -- to reconstruct the climate of that era.
The tree rings from those years were "persistently wide," said Pederson, which he said "suggest that period, climatically speaking, was persistently wet."
Since the mid-20th century, the region has warmed rapidly, and the rings show that recent drought years were the most extreme in more than 1,000-years -- possibly a side effect of global warming.
"Future warming may overwhelm increases in precipitation, leading to similar heat droughts, with potentially severe consequences for modern Mongolia," the authors wrote. 


A reboot of Carl Sagan's "Cosmos" series, which debuted Sunday, aims to show why science matters to individuals and society.
Politics and religion respectively are the driving forces for denial of the overwhelmingly evidence-based sciences of climate change and evolution. The dispute  is among non-scientists who don't understand what the evidence is and how scientific investigations actually work.
James Jones
The trouble is that we have too many people who do not live in reality, and they aren't interested in gaining knowledge. They seem proud of their ignorance. They are descendants of those who locked up scientists daring to claim things such as the Earth goes around the sun.  It's easy to understand how there was a Dark Age.

I'm expecting good things from Neil deGrasse Tyson's version of "Cosmos."  While Sagan's writing was superb, his screen presence wasn't. Tyson's screen persona is excellent.
Dan Schulz
Tyson has mastered science and public education of science. He is a true hero of the genre.

Today, more than ever, we need to regain the sense of awe about the universe that Sagan planted  and Tyson has fostered and will bring to fruition.

Thank you for Bill Sternberg's wonderful column "Can new 'Cosmos' inspire?" (Opinion, Friday).
As a child, I was riveted by Carl Sagan's 1980 PBS series Cosmos, which ran at the pinnacle of a remarkable era in science.  Sagan's Cosmos not only built on this zeitgeist, but also provided a historical framework for conceptualizing science, a captivating narrative and Sagan's unbridled enthusiasm.
Today, as a father of two young children, I would love to see more programs that aspire to popularize science. I hope that Neil deGrasse Tyson's Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey proves to be a worthy successor to Sagan's iconic voyage of the imagination.

The box office is scorching hot this winter; Thanks to animation, climate change grips usually placid season


Hollywood's winter came in like a lion, and it keeps on roaring.
The winter movie season, which officially ended Friday, was up 12.6% over winter 2013, according to Box Office Mojo.
The surge comes courtesy of cartoons. Frozen got the year off to a hot start, and The Lego Movie enjoyed the second-largest debut of any film to open in February, a typically frosty time for moviegoing as Oscar films settle and summer films are far away.
But the normally laconic winter has produced unexpected hits, and ticket sales are on track for a new overall record -- if studios can keep up the pace.
"Box office is trending up," says Ray Subers of Box Office Mojo. He says 2014 could be the first year in film history to crack the $11 billion mark "if that pattern can continue."
To do so, the industry will need more movies like Lego, which opened to an astounding $69.2 million. Only The Passion of the Christ saw a larger February debut, $83.8 million in 2004. Lego stands at $225.8 million, the largest movie of the year so far, and is on its way to $270 million.
Here's a look at some of the season's winners and losers:
Winners
Frozen. Though it was a 2013 release, the Disney tale, which won the Oscar for best animated movie, has collected more than $112.7  million of its overall $393.2  million this year, keeping  sales brisk after kids ended their holiday break.
Ride Along. The Kevin Hart police comedy joins Lego as the only other movie released this year to crack $100 million. The $25 million comedy has collared $130.2 million and made Hart a box-office force.
Lone Survivor. Technically, it's another 2013 release. But the true story of the ill-fated military mission opened wide in January and has earned all but $90,000 of its $124.2  million haul this year.
Losers
RoboCop. The $100 million remake has grossed just $55  million since its opening Feb. 12 and is likely going to doom hopes of a franchise reboot.
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit. Another  revival of a series that flat-lined. Though it cost a meager $60 million, the latest entry in the Tom Clancy franchise managed just $50.1 million. Ryan's missions may be over.
Still, Cinemablend.com's Nick Venable says the hits outweigh the misses. "The polar vortices are still making this country a hassle to travel through. But the box office refuses to chill." 




Obama creates climate tool with Google, Intel, Microsoft; Databases to share stored information


Google plans to create high-resolution drought mapping for the mainland United States as part of a White House effort -- to be unveiled today -- to give communities more data so they can prepare for climate change.
Google, one of several corporate participants, will also use federal databases to build what it says will be the first terrain map of the planet to show how sea levels and other climate-related changes are occurring.
Rebecca Moore,  of Google Earth Engine & Earth Outreach, says  Google aims to help people prepare for extreme heat, drought, sea level rise and flooding "as easily as they use Google maps to get driving directions."
The Obama administration is tapping the expertise and reach of more than a dozen U.S. companies, universities and private groups, as well as the World Bank for its "Climate Data Initiative."
Beginning today, a new weblink -- climate.data.gov -- will be the central site for U.S. government data on climate change.
John Holdren, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology,  says the initiative aims to tap the "ingenuity" of the private sector in developing user-friendly applications and maps, adding: "It's going to be a huge asset in preparing communities for climate change."
Microsoft plans to donate a total of 800 terabytes -- nearly one petabyte -- of cloud storage to 40 climate-change research projects. For communities seeking help, it will customize its free two-year-old "Fetch Climate" tool, which uses satellite and other data to show how an area has changed over time.
Intel plans to host three climate-change "hackathons" this year -- in the  Chesapeake Bay, New Orleans and San Jose. It will challenge engineering and computer science students  to create helpful new apps and tools from existing federal data.
The new data initiative is "an important step to provide this information to users," says Vicki Arroyo, executive director of Georgetown Climate Center, a non-partisan group. Yet, she says while data are necessary,  communities tell her group that they need data in easily accessible and understandable formats. 




Give light to those living in darkness; Earth Hour just a feel-good campaign


At 8:30 p.m. on Saturday, people and public places across the globe will switch off their lights for one hour to raise awareness about the impact of energy use on climate change.
Unfortunately, this Earth Hour event is nothing but an ineffective feel-good event. It does little for the climate in terms of reducing CO2 emissions and distracts us from the real problems and solutions -- especially giving light to those in the darkness.
While more than a billion people participate by shutting off their lights for an hour -- and saving at most the equivalent of China halting its CO2 emissions for fewer than four minutes -- 1.3 billion people across the developing world will continue to live without electricity as they do every other night of the year.
Almost 3 billion people still burn dung, twigs and other traditional fuels indoors to cook and keep warm. These fuels give off noxious fumes that are linked to  4.3 million deaths each year, mostly women and children.
In fact, it was the advent of widespread electrical power that freed us from these harmful practices that still affect large parts of the developing world.
Celebrating darkness signals a turn away from an ever brighter future. This is not just metaphorical because climate policies keep making electricity more expensive. This especially hurts the poor. With electricity prices rising 80% in Germany since 2000, and renewable subsidies of $33 billion this year, 800,000 Germans per year get their power cut off because they can no longer afford to pay the bills.
In the developing world, well-meaning Western governments are opposing the funding of new coal-fired power plants that could avoid rolling blackouts in countries such as Pakistan. Instead, we're now adding more joblessness and economic hopelessness.
And the darkness hits the 1.3 billion people with no electricity the hardest. Increasingly, we insist that they should be allowed electricity only if it is renewable.
Yet, a new analysis from the Center for Global Development finds that by investing $10 billion in renewable energy, we can pull one person out of poverty for about $500. Using gas electrification instead would be more than four times as efficient.  By insisting on renewables, we deliberately choose to leave 60 million people in darkness and poverty. This seems hypocritical, as the rich world gets just 0.8% of its energy from hugely expensive solar and wind technologies, which remain unreliable. Even with optimistic assumptions, the International Energy Agency estimates that by 2035, we will produce just 2.6% of our energy from wind and under 1% from solar.
Most participants celebrate Earth Hour with the best of intentions. But instead of turning off the lights for everyone, let's focus on finding bright solutions that can make a difference for both the climate and the poor.

U.N. escalates climate concerns; Every corner of globe affected, new study says


Climate change is affecting all parts of the globe, and the gap between the latest science on climatic change and government action to cut greenhouse emissions remains large, according to a sweeping U.N. report out today.
"In recent decades, changes in climate have caused impacts ... on all continents and across the oceans," according to a landmark report released today in Yokohama, Japan, by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world's most comprehensive climate-change report ever created.
The devastating effects of recent extreme events and extreme weather disasters also prove that our ability to adapt to a changing climate is low, according to the report.
If left unchecked, the report finds that climate-change risks include:
Coastal flooding, which will devastate areas near the shore.
Widespread hunger due to warming, drought and severe downpours.
Damage to big cities because of inland flooding.
Extreme weather and storms,  damaging some of the things we take for granted, like electricity, running water and emergency services.
Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability is the second in a series of four reports prepared by hundreds of the world's top climate scientists through the IPCC.
The report states that climate change has already affected agriculture, human health, ecosystems,  water supplies and some people's livelihoods. The striking feature of the effects, said the report, is that they are occurring from the tropics to the poles, from small islands to large continents, and from the wealthiest countries to the poorest.
"The report concludes that people, societies and ecosystems are vulnerable around the world, but with different vulnerability in different places, said Stanford's Chris Field, one of the report co-chairs. "Climate change often interacts with other stresses to increase risk."
The report states that the chances and possible outcomes of many of the risks of climate change could still be diminished. However, strong action is needed to decrease the emissions of the greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide) that cause global warming.
Despite warnings from the IPCC,  the gap between the science and what governments are doing remains huge, says Sandeep Chamling Rai, head of the World Wildlife Fund's delegation to the meeting. "The science is clear and the debate is over," he said. "Climate change is happening and humans are the major cause of emissions."

Cage global warming deniers?; Skeptics getting a lot of hot air from activists


Finally, someone has come up with a way to settle the debate over climate change: Put the people on the wrong side of the argument in cages.
A writer for the website Gawker recently penned a self-described "rant" on the pressing need to arrest, charge and imprison people who "deny" global warming. In fairness, Adam Weinstein doesn't want mass arrests (besides, in a country where only 44% of Americans say there is "solid evidence" of global warming and it's mostly due to human activity, you can't round up every dissenter). Fact-checking scientists are spared. So is "the man on the street who thinks Rush Limbaugh is right. ... You all know that man. That man is an idiot. He is too stupid to do anything other than choke the earth's atmosphere a little more with his Mr. Pibb burps and his F-150's gassy exhaust."
But Weinstein's magnanimity ends there. Someone must pay. Weinstein suggests the government simply try the troublemakers and spokespeople. You know, the usual suspects. People like Limbaugh himself as well as ringleaders of political organizations and businesses that refuse to toe the line. "Those malcontents must be punished and stopped."
Serious debate?
Weinstein says that this "is an argument that's just being discussed seriously in some circles." He credits Rochester Institute of Technology philosophy professor Lawrence Torcello for getting the ball rolling. Last month, Torcello argued that America should follow Italy's lead. In 2009, six seismologists were convicted of poorly communicating the risks of a major earthquake. When one struck, the scientists were sentenced to six years in jail for downplaying the risks. Torcello and Weinstein want a similar approach for climate change.
This is a great standard for free speech in America. Let's just agree that the First Amendment reads, "Nothing in this clause shall be considered binding if it contradicts legal practices in the Abruzzo region of Italy."
The truth is this isn't as new an outlook as Weinstein suggests. For instance, in 2009, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman insisted that "deniers" in Congress who opposed the Waxman-Markey climate change bill were committing "treason" while explaining their opposition on the House floor. (That same year, Krugman's fellow Timesman Thomas Friedman wrote that China's authoritarian system was preferable to ours, in part, because it lets "enlightened" leaders deal with climate change.)
"The fact is that the planet is changing faster than even pessimists expected," Krugman insisted. How fast the earth is changing is open to all kinds of debate, but short of an asteroid strike it won't change as fast as the global warming pessimists have claimed. For example, in 2008, Al Gore predicted that the North Pole Ice Cap would be  ice free by 2013. Arctic ice, which never came close to disappearing, has actually been making a bit of comeback lately.
Gore hyperbole
Gore's prediction -- echoed by then Sen. John Kerry and countless others -- was always ridiculous hyperbole. But even most serious, non-hyperbolic, computer-modeled predictions have overestimated the amount of warming we've experienced. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has had to retract several histrionic predictions, such as its erroneous prophecy that the Himalayan glaciers would be gone by 2035.
Its new report, out on Monday, contains a new raft of dire prophecies requiring trillions in new spending. If I greet it with skepticism, shall I pack a tooth brush for my trip to jail?
Climate change activists insist that in science, revisions are routine, and that such corrections prove the good faith of scientists. Even if that's true, one might still note that incentives are unhealthily arranged so that even well-intentioned researchers are encouraged to exaggerate the dangers of climate change and discouraged to criticize hyperbole. Moreover, were it not for the skeptics and deniers, many such corrections would never have been brought to light. (My own view is that man plays some role in warming, but the threat is overblown and the popular remedies range from trivial to unaffordable to ridiculous.)
The real problem is that political activists and many leading institutions, particularly in the news media and academia, are determined to demonize any kind of skepticism -- about the extent of the threat or the efficacy of proposed solutions -- as illegitimate idiocy.
That attitude is unscientific and undemocratic enough. But it sure beats calling for your opponents to be thrown in the gulag for disagreeing with you.

I disagree with a lot of climate change science, but I agree that if it's true, it's a waste of our money to study and try to prevent it.
We can't do it alone. If other countries ignore the issue, then it's out of our control and adapting to the situation makes the most sense.

Whether or not you believe that climate change is occurring, isn't it just common sense to realize that we will inevitably need an alternative to burning fossil fuels -- a finite resource -- and begin to look to the future?
The mind-set of "we're fine now, so nothing should change"  is a recipe for extinction.

For the life of me, I can't understand why intelligent conservatives such as commentary writer Jonah Goldberg relentlessly question the validity of climate research ("Cage global warming deniers?" Opinion, Tuesday).
The overwhelming majority of climate scientists have concluded that human activity is a major factor in the rapid warming of the Earth. Yet Goldberg's view is that the threat is overblown. Based on what? He seems to give his own opinions more credibility than the scientific method.
Goldberg would probably say that even though the overwhelming majority of researchers warn that our overuse of antibiotics is creating superbugs, "My own view is that the threat is overblown."

USA TODAY's article "U.N. escalates  climate concerns" is alarmist at best.  I am a scientist, and many of us do not agree with the United Nations' report that human-generated emissions are the main cause of potential global warming (News, Monday). The Earth's surface air temperatures have plateaued.  And concern over increased carbon dioxide is misrepresented. CO2 is necessary for proper plant photosynthesis, wherein plant organisms use light to help convert the gas into sugars and issue oxygen as a byproduct. That oxygen is a good thing. It's what we breathe.

Climate report says it's now or never; U.N. panel calls for urgent transition to clean energy


A rapid shift to less-polluting energy will be needed to avoid catastrophic global warming because worldwide emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases have accelerated to unprecedented levels, the United Nations says.
These emissions -- largely from the burning of oil, gas and coal -- grew more quickly between 2000 and 2010 than in any of the three previous decades, according to a landmark report by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). They will need to be slashed 40% to 70% by midcentury and almost entirely by century's end to keep global temperatures from spiraling out of control, the panel says.
Even those emissions cuts might not be enough.
The IPCC report, striking a particularly urgent tone, says countries might even need to enlist controversial technologies that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
"There is a clear message from science: To avoid dangerous interference with the climate system," said Ottmar Edenhofer of Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, who co-chaired the report.
The report, written by 235 scientists from 57 countries, looks at myriad ways to fight climate change and serves as a potential road map for policymakers.
"If we do nothing, temperatures will continue to rise," co-author Leon Clarke, a scientist at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, said from Berlin.  "It's not necessarily a phaseout of fossil fuels," he said, but rather "a phaseout" of power plants and other facilities that don't capture the carbon they emit.
Despite global efforts to mitigate climate change, the report says global greenhouse gas emissions rose 2.2% annually in the past decade -- nearly twice the  rate of 1.3% from 1970 to 2000.
ExxonMobil, the largest U.S. oil and gas company, said in a March31 report that global climate policies are "highly unlikely" to stop it from producing and selling fossil fuels.
"The risk of climate change is clear, and the risk warrants action," William Colton, the company's vice president of corporate strategic planning, said in a statement. 


 shift to clean energy is needed to combat catastrophic global warming, according to a report released Sunday by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
I will believe that the forecasters of catastrophic results are serious when they propose rationing of fossil fuels -- the only guaranteed way to reduce consumption -- and a Manhattan Project-scope program to build carbon dioxide scrubber/sequestration devices in all urban areas of the country.
We have known how to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere for a century.
Richard Bunce
History teaches us that the Earth has had many massive climatic changes.
A major concern that some have with global warming predictions is that it comes across as little minds playing guessing games when compared with major events of the past.

The U.N. report says we should be looking at clean energy, but exactly what sources should we be looking at? And who's going to pay for it all?
A big part of the problem are China and India, countries that don't seem to have any kind of pollution controls at all.

OK, we have a problem. As a nation, we've been presented with the facts over and over, but what are the solutions?  Carbon capture and sequestration? A national water grid? Changes in traffic laws to cut down gridlock? Seems like what we're getting now is just more talk and more studies.

Instead of saying that "97% of climate scientists have concluded that human-caused climate change is happening," as was stated in the column "On climate change, expect the worst" (USATODAY.com, Saturday), it should have been 100%.
All competent climate scientists know that humans contribute to climate change through land-use change (e.g., urbanization), and pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. That is not the issue.
The real question is, are our greenhouse gas emissions going to cause incredibly dangerous amounts of climate change in the future? No one really knows the answer to this question; and predictions of high amounts of danger may be overblown. Only if it will be dangerous should this be a big public policy concern.
Overconfidence about the future of climate change has resulted in large amounts of money being spent worldwide to stop things that may or may not happen in the distant future.
Only a small amount is going to help real people suffering today due to climate change, however caused. This is the real climate crisis.

Climate change to be visible by ZIP code; Online tool will show how sea levels are expected to rise


With the click of a computer mouse, the risks of rising sea levels will soon be searchable -- by ZIP code -- for all U.S. coastal communities.
An online mapping tool will show how much sea levels are expected to rise in each area, as well as the number of residents and buildings that could be flooded. Initially launched in March 2012 for New York, New Jersey and Florida, it will expand to cover New England on Wednesday, the Pacific states later this spring and the rest of the coastal U.S. by the end of summer.
"This is a brave new world. Rising seas are posing a totally new challenge to American ingenuity," says Ben Strauss, vice president for climate impacts at Climate Central, a non-profit group based in Princeton, N.J. It used private foundation funding to create the Surging Seas database. The results, based on data from more than 10 federal agencies, tell a sobering story.
In New York City,  different projections suggest the sea level will rise nearly a foot by 2040. But with future storms,  there's more than a one in three chance for a 6-foot flood by that year, Strauss says. That would be more than a foot higher than anything on record except Superstorm Sandy, which caused widespread devastation  in Manhattan and parts of New Jersey in October 2012. It also would  be  enough to threaten the subway system again, Strauss says.
With  Earth Day arriving  Tuesday, Surging Seas is part of a new generation of free  tools, made possible by  improvements in computing  and data availability, that show how local climates are changing as global temperatures rise. Another, launched in February, lets  people  see deforestation, which exacerbates global warming, in real time.
"It's groundbreaking," says Crystal Davis of World Resources Institute, a non-profit  in Washington, D.C. It spent more than two years working with Google and more than 40  partners to build Global Forest Watch.
"It wasn't possible to do this even a few years ago."
This tool reveals how much tree coverage has been lost -- or, in same places, gained -- each year since 2000. Worldwide, it shows that nearly 900,000 square miles of tree cover has disappeared in those 13 years, equal to  losing 50 soccer fields' worth of forest every minute.
One of the world's top deforestation hot spots is Atlanta's suburbs, where urban sprawl and rising demand for bigger houses has led to extensive tree loss.
The mapping tool even shows the effect of local development. Its map of Washington, D.C., has pink spots on New York Avenue, where a 15-acre parcel was mostly cleared  to build a Walmart  until the deal collapsed last fall.
Davis says researchers used to have a multiyear lag in  understanding global deforestation, but that's no longer so,  thanks to NASA satellite data,  as well as the University of Maryland's algorithms and Google's computing.
"It would have taken decades to produce such high-resolution maps on a single computer," says Rebecca Moore, engineering manager of Google Earth Engine, which used 10,000 computers to do so in two days. Google, using images from NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey, has also built Timelapse, which shows dramatic changes in parts of the world in the past 40 years -- notably, Las Vegas' growth, Wyoming's coal mining, Alaska's Columbia Glacier retreat and Canada's tar sands extraction.
Google also plans to create a  drought map for the  United States as part of the Obama administration's Climate Data Initiative, launched  with the help of more than a dozen U.S. companies, universities and private groups, as well as the World Bank.
The U.S. government unveiled a new link -- climate.data.gov -- to be its  website for climate data and applications, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's National Stormwater Calculator. This tool, for  site developers and homeowners, estimates  annual amounts of rainwater and frequency of runoff from sites  anywhere in the USA.
There's also the Aqueduct Atlas from  the World Resources Institute, which uses a variety of data sources to track the world's supply, access to and quality of water. 


 an activist or a scientist. She's a homeowner with problems: cracks in the garage's foundation and the sidewalk. Perhaps the strangest is the heaving of her backyard deck by as much as 7 inches a day. The reason? Thawing of the surface layer of her land, which sits on permafrost -- ground that's frozen below -- rumpled the concrete pillars holding up the deck.
Driving around Fairbanks, I saw how thawing permafrost has caused homes and trees to tilt and roads to buckle. It's not a new problem, but global warming is making it worse.
These and other problems are highlighted in a federal report compiled by hundreds of scientists and released Tuesday by the White House. The National Climate Assessment says climate change is not a distant threat but rather a reality already affecting American lives.
In Norfolk, Va., where the sea level is rising, I met Bob Parsons and Jennifer Priest, whose homes have repeatedly flooded. In Spicewood, Texas, drought has triggered severe watering restrictions. Resident C.J. Teare was using soapy water left from washing clothes to try to keep her decades-old oaks alive. In the Chicago area, doctors and patients said allergies are getting worse as the pollen count rises -- and that's also linked to a rise in greenhouse gas emissions.
To be sure, there's skepticism. I heard from folks who say they don't believe in climate change, even though they see intensifying problems in their communities that science attributes (at least partly) to global warming.
Climate change is the most difficult issue I've covered in 30 years as a journalist. It's become so politicized and controversial that people are often confused. It's complex. While more than 97% of climate scientists agree on the broad contours of climate change -- namely that its primary driver now is the burning of fossil fuels -- there's still a lot they don't know about the details.
I know I've been shaken. Four years ago, when prepping for an interview with author and activist Bill McKibben about his book, Eaarth: Making a Life on a Tough New Planet, I had to stop reading. His description of how the world was melting, drying, acidifying, flooding and burning in heretofore unseen ways was just too frightening.
But despite all the bad news, what's encouraging is the plethora of technological advances in clean energy. Says Harvard chemist Daniel Nocera, who told me about his own "artificial leaf" for producing hydrogen fuel: "I'm totally optimistic."

Climate costs AlREADY hit home; Report: Disasters linked to warming will only get worse


Devastating droughts in the Southwest, ruinous floods in New York City, killer wildfires in Colorado, intense heat waves in the Plains: These are some of the disasters today that are being exacerbated by global warming, and will continue to worsen in coming  decades, says  a massive federal climate report released Tuesday  at the White House.
Climate change is affecting where and how Americans live and work, as well as their health. Evidence is mounting that burning fossil fuels has made extreme weather such as heat waves and heavy precipitation much more likely in the USA, according to the National Climate Assessment (NCA), the largest, most comprehensive U.S.-focused climate change report ever produced.
President Obama reinforced the message Tuesday in interviews  with meteorologists from national and local television outlets. "This is not some distant problem of the future," he told Today show meteorologist Al Roker. "This is a problem that is affecting Americans right now. Whether it means increased flooding, greater vulnerability to drought, more severe wildfires -- all these things are having an impact on Americans as we speak." Others echoed the sentiments.
"If people took the time to read the report, they would see that it is not necessarily about polar bears, whales or butterflies," said meteorologist Marshall Shepherd of the University of Georgia. "I care about all of those, but the NCA is about our kids, dinner table issues, and our well being."
"Climate change is here and now, and not in some distant time or place," agreed Texas Tech University climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, one of the authors of the 800-page report. "The choices we're making today will have a significant impact on our future."
The assessment, prepared by 300 of the USA's top scientists and other experts, provides "the loudest and clearest alarm bell to date" for immediate and aggressive climate action, said John Holdren, President Obama's science adviser.
"Corn producers in Iowa, oyster growers in Washington state and maple syrup producers in Vermont are all observing climate-related changes that are outside of recent experience," the U.S. report stated. "So, too, are coastal planners in Florida, water managers in the arid Southwest, city dwellers from Phoenix to New York and native peoples on tribal lands from Louisiana to Alaska."
While scientists continue to refine projections of the future climate, observations unequivocally show that the climate is changing and that the warming of the past 50 years is primarily due to human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide and methane.
Specifically, the report warns that  the three most significant threats from climate change in the USA are sea-level rise along the coasts, droughts and fires in the Southwest and extreme precipitation events across the USA.
"There are a lot of troubling findings here, but one of the most striking regards sea-level rise," said Patrick Sullivan of the Center for Biological Diversity. "The report says we could see as much as four feet of sea-level rise this century, with regional variations. That will pose major storm surge and flood threats to major coastal communities like New York, Boston, and Houston."
The report was quickly labeled as "alarmist" by some in Congress and industry groups.  But representatives from oil companies such as ConocoPhillips and Chevron and environmental groups such as the Nature Conservancy endorsed the assessment's findings.
"Chevron recognizes and shares the concerns of governments and the public about climate change," said Chevron spokesman Justin Higgs.
The Obama administration is expanding its climate initiative, launched last year, with rules to limit carbon emissions from power plants. In June, the Environmental Protection Agency is expected to finalize limits, proposed last year, on new plants.
The agency also plans to set standards for existing ones, which could prompt the closure of some coal-fired facilities. Several GOP members of Congress have described the rules  as Obama's "war on coal."
Indeed, some Republican senators immediately assailed the report. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said Obama was likely to "use the platform to renew his call for a national energy tax. And I'm sure he'll get loud cheers from liberal elites -- from the kind of people who leave a giant carbon footprint and then lecture everybody else about low-flow toilets."
The American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity was also not impressed with the assessment, saying that the White House had again resorted to unsubstantiated scare tactics and hyperbole instead of engaging in a serious discussion about the costs and long-term economic consequences posed by rash federal regulations.
A vast majority of climate scientists -- generally pegged at 97% --  concur with the basics of the science behind climate change, though some still find flaws in the details.
One study last week, for instance, in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Climate Change found that the impacts of extreme heat due to climate change might be exaggerated.
Another meteorologist not a part of the assessment, Bryan Wood of Assurant Specialty Property Insurance, tweeted Tuesday that "one thing I don't like about the NCA website: They speak in absolutes on some things the actual report has low confidence on."
However, the voices of doubters  were few and far between on Tuesday. "From drought and flooding risks, to food insecurity and increased risk of disease, small towns and large states, the agricultural and energy sectors, and businesses from Wall Street to Main Street are feeling the consequences today," said American Geophysical Union executive director Christine McEntee.

Global warming's ground zero; Rising sea levels put 'trillions of dollars' at risk


Miami and other parts of South Florida, where streets routinely flood at lunar high tides, comprise one of the  most vulnerable hot spots for climate change.
"It's remarkable. We get calls from people asking: 'It didn't rain, so why is my street underwater?'" says Broward County Commissioner Kristin Jacobs, noting the region's decades-old system to drain water is now causing it to bubble back up.
"I have a photo of a man swimming -- doing the backstroke -- in his cul de sac," she says, adding that 30% of her county -- just north of Miami -- is 5 feet or fewer above sea level.
Jacobs attended the White House's release Tuesday of the National Climate Assessment, a massive study by scientists that finds rising temperatures are already  affecting the United States. It notes  Miami -- along with New Orleans, Tampa, Virginia Beach and Charleston, S.C. -- is most at risk for sea-level rise.
As Earth's temperature warms, so do the seas, because warmer water takes up more room than cooler water. Globally, sea level has risen about 8inches since reliable record-keeping began in 1880 and is most likely to rise another 1 to 4 feet  by 2100, the report says.
That's bad news for the highly developed coasts of Florida's southern tip, where land is flat, low-lying and swampy.
"The underlying rock is limestone, which allows groundwater to seep in," says Leonard Berry, director of Florida Atlantic University's Center for Environmental Studies, noting he's seen even swanky cars like Lamborghinis flooded. He says the porous bedrock makes it difficult to build a sea wall that will keep out saltwater intrusion, because such a barrier would have to go down at least 60 feet.
"Trillions of dollars of investments ... are going to be vulnerable," Berry says, especially since the region is prone to hurricanes that can bring storm surges made worse by sea-level rise.
The region also has a disproportionate share of elderly residents, many ironically drawn to Florida for its balmy weather, says Vicki Arroyo, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Georgetown Climate Center. She says the elderly, more susceptible in heat waves and less apt to relocate in storms, were hardest hit when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005.
Even a sea-level rise of 6 inches will be costly in South Florida. "That will happen in the next two to three decades," says Ben Strauss of Climate Central, a Princeton-based non-profit group that used federal data for  its Surging Seas database. The region's most likely rise in sea level will range between 5 and 13 inches by 2040, according to federal projections.
So by mid-century, Strauss says there's at least a 78% chance of severe flooding of at least 2 feet above the high-tide line.
Sea levels are rising more quickly in other places, notably Virginia's Norfolk area, but Strauss says South Florida is  vulnerable because of its topography, population and infrastructure.

Vlulnerable cities across USA
Here's a look at some cities that could suffer  various  effects of climate change.
Heavy precipitation
Burlington, Vt.; Hartford, Conn.; and Providence
Quick outbursts of rain and snow, or "extreme precipitation," have increased by more than 70% in the past six decades in the northeastern U.S.
Heat waves
Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City and St. Louis
Midwest warming  has  accelerated  the past few decades. Between 1900 and 2010,  average Midwest air temperature increased  more than 1.5 degrees.
Allergies
Atlanta; Birmingham, Ala.; Louisville; Memphis; and
Richmond, Va.
Climate change, resulting in more frost-free days and warmer seasonal air temperatures, can contribute to shifts in flowering time and pollen initiation from allergenic plant species.
Wildfires
Albuquerque, Denver and Phoenix
Increased warming, drought and insect outbreaks -- all caused by or linked to climate change -- have increased wildfires and the effect on people and ecosystems across the rising populations of the Southwest. 




Airports most at flood risk; White House issues climate change alarm


Twelve of the country's 47 largest airports are vulnerable to storm surges that are expected to increase from climate change, according to a White House report released earlier this week.
The U.S. National Climate Assessment released Tuesday warned that coastal airports with at least one runway 12 feet or less above sea level could suffer flooding during moderate to high storm surges.
The report noted that metro New York's big three airports -- John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark -- already flooded in October 2012 during the 14-foot tidal surge from Hurricane Sandy. LaGuardia closed for three days.
LaGuardia already maintains a dike and pumps for floodwaters, according to a 2002 Transportation Department report cited by the White House. "Many coastal airports are vulnerable to flooding," the report noted. "Extreme high tides, coupled with flood conditions, can reach close to the existing levels."
Sea levels are projected to rise 1 to 4 feet this century, and more frequent storms from climate change could  flood runways or force construction of expensive barriers, the report said.
The damage from Hurricane Sandy served as a wake-up call for airports, said Chris Oswald, vice president of safety and regulatory affairs for Airports Council International-North America.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has announced $37.5 million in improvements for LaGuardia, saying "the question is not if another storm will hit, but when."

hat long ago, leading Republicans took strong positions on climate change. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the party's 2008 presidential nominee, co-authored legislation to cap greenhouse gas emissions. And former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee presented the fight against global warming as a religious cause.
These days, it's difficult to find a Republican candidate willing to speak out in favor of doing something. Anyone who does so risks defeat in GOP primaries, where ardent climate change skeptics hold sway.
This is a problem for the country, indeed the world.
The National Climate Assessment, released this week, adds to a mounting and overwhelming body of evidence that the effects of rising temperatures are here and now -- and that even higher sea levels, more extreme weather and water shortages are in our future if nothing is done.
Addressing the threat won't be easy, or popular. But denying that a problem even exists -- which is common among the most vocal of Republicans -- risks branding the party as one that is anti-science and refuses to participate in constructive governance.
As a way of getting back to where it was a few years ago, the Republican Party might want to start with three basic questions: Is there globe warming? Is the change primarily caused by human activity? And, if so, what can and should be done about it?
The first question ought to be beyond dispute at this point. The new climate assessment found that U.S. temperatures have warmed 1.3 to 1.9 degrees since 1895, with most of the increase coming since 1970. Sea levels have risen a foot or more in some U.S. cities, flooding rainstorms have increased in the Northeast and droughts have worsened in the West.
The second question is a bit more complicated. The climate is always changing because of natural variability and factors such as volcanic activity and solar radiation.  Even so, 97% of climate scientists agree that the burning of fossil fuels is the primary driver of the warming observed in recent decades.
Should policy really be based on the minuscule chance that they're wrong?
The third question, though, is far more difficult to answer. New limits on emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, needed to prevent global warming from getting totally out of hand, would likely have a dampening effect on the economy, at least in the near term. It's not an appealing prospect for voters, who've shown little willingness to sacrifice now to protect future generations.
What's more, unilateral U.S. action would have little effect if reluctant industrializing countries, particularly China, cannot be persuaded to act as well.
In that context, what to do -- and at what cost -- is a debate worth having.
Given the increasing scientific certainty about global warming, and the likelihood that public opinion will shift in the face of ever more compelling evidence, Republicans should be thinking of ways of getting out in front of the issue.
Otherwise, like climate change itself, it will overtake them before they can react. 



Glaciers in Antarctica are irreversibly melting from global warming and ozone loss, according to new research. This could raise sea levels by 4 feet or more in coming centuries.
Quite a few people are in denial about climate change. Ask individuals to live their lives in a slightly more restrained way or to be more conscious of their impact on the environment, and they are quick to judge and reach for anything to convince them that what they're doing is really not that bad.
Scientists are just saying  that, as a whole, we need to consider how we affect the community and our planet.
Mark Mathias
Climate change is a natural process.  The point is, we're doing nothing to help decelerate the process.  We're accelerating it. Whether our influence is minimal or great, why is it so hard to say, "Let's do everything we can to make sure it isn't us."
Stephen Castiglione
I believe the climate is changing, but I don't believe we can stop it. Even if the U.S. did adopt an energy conservation policy, Russia and China won't. All that would happen is more Americans would lose their jobs.

I don't understand Republican naysayer logic expressed by Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., regarding the cost of addressing climate change on a federal level ("We don't need more red tape," Opposing view, Global warming debate, May 9).
Climate change is a national -- actually international -- problem and not just an issue that requires a piecemeal solution. Is it realistic to think that coal mining states will put the nation's long-term environmental good before their short-term economic interests?
George W. Bush is comfortable letting history be the judge of the Iraq War, even though he will be long gone and unavailable to answer for or suffer any consequences.  People like Barrasso are suggesting the same thing in regard to climate change. It seems to be enough if his constituents are happy.
This is selfish given the global consequences if we don't take the lead in this cause.

How about doing something about it? Like the rest of the modern world. The USA is so behind in so many ways.

Climate change could wipe out many landmarks; Floods, storms, fires endanger historic sites


Climate change is putting historic and cultural landmarks around the USA at risk, according to a report released today by the Union of Concerned Scientists, a non-profit science advocacy organization based in Washington, D.C.
"Sea-level rise, coastal erosion, increased flooding, heavy rains and more frequent large wildfires are damaging archaeological resources, historic buildings and cultural landscapes across the nation," says the report, National Landmarks at Risk.
The report, which was not a peer-reviewed study, includes 30 at-risk locations, including places where the "first Americans" lived, the Spaniards ruled, English colonists landed, slavery rose and fell, and gold prospectors struck it rich.
Locations include the Statue of Liberty; Jamestown, Va.; the Cape Hatteras (N.C.) Lighthouse; and the Kennedy Space Center.
"You can almost trace the history of the United States through these sites," says Adam Markham, director of climate impacts at UCS and report co-author.
Sea levels already have risen 1 to 2 feet across portions of the East and Gulf Coast, USA TODAY reported last year, and global sea levels will rise about 1 foot to slightly more than 3 feet by 2100, according to this year's Fifth Assessment Report by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
Many at-risk sites are national parks, including Mesa Verde, Bandelier, Cape Hatteras and the Everglades. According to the National Park Service, 96% of park service land is in areas where global warming has been observed in the past century.
According to the UCS report, one historic site -- Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in the Americas --will likely be underwater by the end of the century.
The Kennedy Space Center and surrounding Cape Canaveral area in Florida, site of the Apollo launch, are threatened by storm surges that regularly breach dunes near the launch pads.
In the West, climate change is increasing the risk of large wildfires in places such as California's Sierra Nevada, the report says. Across the region, wildfire season lasts two months longer than in the 1970s.
"There is a tendency to confuse the impacts of climate with the impacts of human-caused climate change," says Chip Knappenberger of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington.
"This most certainly is taking place in the UCS report. Most of the examples in the report are located in areas where the extremes of the natural climate pose significant threats and expose vulnerabilities," he says. 




'Lumbering giants' stir things up; How changing climate may affect ocean turbulence


A 70-foot wave is a terrifying wall of water that only the best surfers can ride. But it's a midget compared with the colossal and mysterious waves that lurk under the ocean's surface.
These underwater waves, though seldom noticed, can rival skyscrapers in height and measure more than 100 miles wide. They can imperil submarines and disrupt operations on offshore oil platforms. They've been photographed by astronauts in orbit and cursed by bewildered sailors. Scientists are gaining fresh insights into these massive waves, including their potentially important role in climate change.
Underwater waves "are the lumbering giants of the ocean," says MIT oceanographer Thomas Peacock, who studies them. Such waves "roll around the planet. ... But we see only little glimpses of them, because we live our lives above the surface."
These mammoth bulges of water, properly known as internal waves, owe their existence to the structure of the ocean, which is layered like a birthday cake. The upper layer -- the water closest to the surface -- is warmer and lighter, while the lower layer is colder and denser. When the tide pushes the layers over a ridge on the seafloor, a gargantuan wave is born at the transition from warmer to colder water, where the frosting between the layers would be. Winds from big storms also can generate internal waves.
These deep waves are the same shape as their whitecapped cousins on the surface. But a typical surface wave is 1 to 2 feet high, while a run-of-the-mill internal wave measures 15 to 30 feet out at sea, larger when it gets close to shore. Like the wind itself, the waves are both ubiquitous and, to the untutored eye, invisible.
"The whole ocean is filled with these internal waves," says Maarten Buijsman, a physical oceanographer at the University of New Orleans, but "it's really hard to see them if you're standing on the beach." That's because these behemoths create only tiny ridges of water on the  surface. Someone who knows what to look for may spot the alternating bands of smooth and rough water created by the meeting between internal  and surface waves.
Underwater waves move at a ponderous 6 to 7 mph, but their leisurely pace conceals their immense power. Submariners during World War II knew to avoid the Strait of Gibraltar, famed for its internal waves, says David Farmer, a physical oceanographer at the University of Rhode Island. In the 1980s, a Soviet submarine smashed into the bottom of a container ship, presumably because an internal wave tossed the sub as if it were a bath toy.
Scientists have made the first measurements of internal waves breaking at a crucial spot in the Pacific. About 200 miles northeast of Samoa, a huge volume of seawater -- equal to 35 Amazon rivers -- barrels through a narrow underwater channel, then wends into the depths of the northern Pacific. Researchers led by University of Washington oceanographer Matthew Alford found that 800-foot-high internal waves act like a gargantuan mixer at the spot, churning together seawaters of different saltiness and temperature until they're thoroughly blended together.
The discovery provides insight into the source and strength of ocean turbulence, which helps drive the Earth's "circulation," the global movement of seawater that is crucial for understanding climate. The scientists reported their results last fall in Geophysical Research Letters.
Half an ocean away from the Samoan "nozzle," as Alford calls it, some of the world's biggest internal waves are born in the South China Sea between Taiwan and the Philippines. These giants can measure more than 1,000 feet high, but the biggest collapse as soon as they're born. Only the "smaller" ones continue out to sea,  and these can grow 450 feet, taller than the Statue of Liberty.
To understand  these monsters, Peacock's team built a precise 16-foot-long model of the bottom of the South China Sea and immersed it in a rotating water tank about as wide as a basketball court. They recreated the tides by pushing the water to and fro with wedge-shaped paddles, while the tank's rotation simulated the Earth's spinning. The experiment, the largest ever in the laboratory to study internal waves, showed that the big waves are spawned by water sloshing over entire underwater ridges, not just one small spot on the ridge. Their study was published in November in Geophysical Research Letters.
More than pure science is at stake in such studies. These low-profile waves are "absolutely key for understanding climate change," Alford says. Internal waves influence ocean turbulence, which in turn affects the  network of ocean currents that carries heat around the globe.
Recent research suggests  there will be more internal waves in the Arctic Ocean as the summer sea ice  shrinks because of climate change, Peacock says. That's likely to increase mixing of the sea, which could bring warm water from the bottom to the surface and lead to even more ice loss.
Internal waves "hide beneath the surface," Peacock says. "But they have profound implications." 




EPA wants carbon cut 30%; Plan would reduce emissions as part of climate-change fight


The Environmental Protection Agency will unveil a sweeping proposal today that will require deep cuts in carbon emissions from existing power plants, including a 30% national target by 2030, according to two people briefed on the plan.
The EPA draft rule, a major plank of President Obama's initiative to fight climate change, will require states to develop and implement plans to cut power plant emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide. It will give states different reduction targets but will seek a national average -- from 2005 levels -- of 25% by 2020 and 30% by 2030, say those familiar with the plan.
Last June, Obama  asked the EPA to use its authority under the Clean Air Act to limit power plants emissions, which account for the largest share -- nearly 40% -- of total U.S. emissions. Coal-fired facilities will be hardest hit.
The rule, expected to trigger legal challenges, will not take effect for at least two more years. Obama has asked the EPA to finalize it in June 2015, after which the states will have at least a year to craft their plans.
In his Saturday radio address, Obama said cutting carbon emissions will reduce air pollution, improve health and spur a clean energy economy that can be "an engine of growth."
In the GOP Saturday radio address, Wyoming's Sen. Mike Enzi warned if the Obama administration succeeds,  "we'll all be paying a lot more money for electricity -- if we can get it."
The EPA declined to discuss  details before today's announcement, some of which the Wall Street Journal first reported Sunday. "Until then the agency will not comment on any information that may or may not be in the proposal," said agency spokeswoman Liz Purchia. 

 weeks, the scientific warnings about global warming have been coming in faster than a line of summer thunderstorms. Authoritative studies have documented rising sea levels, "irreversible" ice sheet melting, a northward migration of the tropics and climate-induced conflict.
There's no guarantee that the Obama administration's new limits on carbon emissions from existing power plants, announced Monday, can reverse these ominous trends. Global warming is, by definition, a global problem. Even if America meets the administration's goal of a 30% reduction from 2005 levels by 2030, the U.S. reductions will be swamped by increases elsewhere if other big polluting nations don't follow suit.
Does this mean the new rules aren't worth the effort? Hardly.
If the plan survives political and legal assaults, it will prevent a not-inconsequential hundreds of millions of tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. It will make solar and wind power more competitive with fossil fuels. And it will improve public health at home by reducing other emissions from coal plants, the largest source of greenhouse gases.
Most important, the proposal will give the U.S., the world's second largest carbon emitter after China, far more leverage in upcoming international climate talks. "This is the United States' way to show it is in the game," says David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Because a head-in-the-sand Congress has refused to put a price on carbon pollution, the administration opted for the next best approach. The Environmental Protection Agency is using its authority under the Clean Air Act to set state standards, based on their energy mixes. States can use a variety of ways to meet their goals. These flexible rules recognize that total emissions are more important than how much comes out of each smokestack.
Even before the new EPA rules were announced, they set off the usual flurry of warring economic prognostications. Business groups warned of skyrocketing utility bills and job losses. Environmental groups claim electric bills will drop and new green-energy jobs will flourish.
Who's right? The history of environmental regulations has been that scare stories haven't panned out. But it's reasonable to conclude that the new rules will cause electric rates to rise in some regions, particularly in coal-dependent states such as Kentucky, Wyoming, West Virginia, Indiana and North Dakota.
Even so, a singular focus on electric bills overlooks the high costs of inaction for taxpayers everywhere -- in storm damage, sea wall construction and droughts.
There's a tiny chance, of course, that the scientific consensus on climate disruption is too alarmist. But there's also a chance that scientists are being overly conservative for fear of being labeled alarmist.
When the fate of the planet is in question, prudent risk management involves  preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. So far, the U.S. has mainly prepared for the best and hoped against the worst.
The EPA plan marks the start of a far saner approach, one that will resonate globally. 


rming. The tension between science and religion. The search for extraterrestrial life. Not the typical stuff of prime-time network television. As Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey ends its 13-week run Sunday on Fox and Monday on National Geographic Channel, host Neil deGrasse Tyson and executive producer Ann Druyan discussed these and other controversial topics with the USA TODAY Editorial Board. Questions and answers have been edited for length and clarity.
Q: So, are people watching?
Druyan: I co-wrote the original Cosmos series with my late husband, Carl Sagan, and with Steve Soter, an astronomer. And here I am some 34 years later with this new series, thrilled, especially because I learned yesterday that Sunday night's episode took the ratings for the night. A show on global warming actually came in with identical ratings (among adults 18-49) to The Bachelorette!
Q: Did Fox try to control the content?
Tyson: Many people branded Fox by the editorial policies of Fox News and assumed that Cosmos would just be completely destroyed in this venue. But we knew better, of course. We wouldn't have agreed without that kind of assurance. Fox basically said, "We don't know anything about documentaries, so just go ahead and do what you do."
Q: The morning after Sunday night's scary episode on global warming, the Obama administration announced historic limits on carbon emissions.
Druyan: Sheer coincidence.
Tyson: Cosmos landed independently of whatever the White House planned or is thinking about. We just did this without any reference to prevailing politics.
Q: Why should we worry about human-induced climate change?
Tyson: All the great cities of the world are on water, on ocean ports, on river deltas. That's where the great cities of the world are, over the 10,000 years that we created civilization. The climate fluctuates, but it doesn't come out of a range over which we figured out how to create civilization. You now take it out of the range, the world changes in a way that disrupts how we do business every day on this planet. That's the problem.
Q: A recent AP poll found about 40% of Americans don't believe in, or are skeptical of, the prevailing science on global warming, evolution and the age of the Earth. Do you find that discouraging?
Druyan: Let's take that poll again now that Cosmos has been on TV and see if there is any difference. I would love to see what that poll is and if we have succeeded in moving that needle any amount at all.
Tyson: In a free country, you have the right to think whatever the hell you want and no one should be able to stop you. I don't have a problem with people having belief systems. It becomes a problem when you have a non-objectively based belief system and you are in control. And you write legislation. And you are tasked with governance. That is a recipe for disaster.
Q: What do you say to people who believe the world is only 6,000 years old, not four-and-a-half  billion?
Tyson: First of all, I would say stay out of the science classroom. That is really my only issue here. Or stay out of governance because you are not going to base ideas on a rationally objective truth. We have stars that are 100,000 light years away. We see them. Their light has been traveling for 100,000 years. If you want to assert that the universe is 6,000 years old, you are in denial of the whole universe that lies beyond that sphere of 6,000 light years from the sun.
Q: Are we going to find other intelligent life and communicate with it?
Druyan: I feel very strongly, and Carl always did, that in the absence of evidence, we should withhold judgment. But with a couple hundred million stars in this one galaxy, and at least a hundred billion galaxies, I find it intuitively unlikely that we are the only intelligent beings in the universe.
Tyson: Maybe we have been visited and observed by other intelligent life, and they chose not to engage because there was no sign of intelligent life on Earth by their measure of intelligence. It is actually hubristic that we think that we would be able to identify another form of intelligent life if they are more intelligent than we are.
Q: What do you think about the direction of the space program and plans for a manned mission to Mars?
Tyson: I am disappointed that we live in a time where a president can declare that we are going to send astronauts to Mars, as President Obama did in his speech in 2010 -- but not until the 2030s. I was there. It was a rousing speech, as so many of his speeches are. Send astronauts to Mars. How could you not embrace that if you are a space enthusiast? But I wonder what it means for a president to commit a space program that would be overseen by a president to be named later, on a budget that is not established. Suppose John Kennedy had said, "We will put a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth sometime in the next couple of decades." We would have never been to the moon.
Q: Why are women and African Americans so underrepresented in science and technology, particularly in Silicon Valley?
Druyan: With my children, when I looked at their high school science textbooks, I felt nothing but despair. All these goose-bump raising ideas had been denuded of any feeling or excitement -- really just sterilized to the point of being completely uninteresting. This is why I set out to do this show. I believe that we are a story-driven species. We stopped telling the stories of the heroes of science about 30 years ago. We stopped giving examples of what it means to struggle to find out how the universe is put together.
Q: Carl Sagan was once blackballed from membership in the National Academy of Sciences. Do scientists still suffer for being popularizers?
Tyson: I exist in a field that has been cleared by Carl Sagan. As best as I can read in the attitudes of my colleagues, my activities in bringing science to the public have had no negative impact on how they view or treat me. I measure that by the fact that I have several standing invitations from elite institutions that said when Cosmos is over, if you need to take a year off, come here and we can jump-start your research program. They would not come near me with a 10-foot-pole if they felt that I was somehow tainted goods.

This documentary follows American soccer coach Bob Bradley as he takes over the Egyptian national team -- shortly after the 2011 revolution that overthrew the Mubarak government. While the country struggles with political upheaval, Bradley and the team makes a run at a seemingly unattainable goal: qualifying for the 2014 World Cup.
Louie FX, 10:30 ET/PT
This FX comedy ends its most controversial season. Not everything worked, though you probably shouldn't expect  consistency from a show this eccentric and idiosyncratic. But even its missteps were thought-provoking, and the triumphs -- including a long "fat girl" speech from Sarah Baker that should play in every high school and should by all rights earn her an Emmy nod -- rank with this year's best and most memorable TV work. 




Without action, climate change could slam economy; Bipartisan report paints grim picture






Climate change poses profound risks to the U.S. economy and needs to be addressed immediately, says a bipartisan report Tuesday by a coalition of financial leaders that includes three former Treasury secretaries.
Two of the most severe impacts -- sea level rise and extreme heat -- will likely cost billions of dollars in annual property loss, threaten  health, lower labor productivity and endanger electric grids, says the report by the Risky Business Project.
"The risks are more perverse and cruel than we saw with the financial crisis, because they accumulate over time," Henry Paulson Jr.,  Treasury secretary for President George W. Bush, said, noting that heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions linger in the atmosphere a long time.
"The good news: If we act immediately, we can avert the worst outcomes," Paulson said, adding U.S. businesses need to unite and lead the push for national change.
"We cannot afford to waste another minute," said Michael Bloomberg, GOP New York mayor  from 2002 through 2013. He said rising sea levels will make storms such as 2012's Sandy  worse. Paulson and Bloomberg,  with billionaire former hedge fund executive and Democrat Thomas Steyer, led the project that produced the report, compiled by climate scientists and the economic research firm Rhodium Group. Their panel  also includes George Shultz, Treasury secretary for President Nixon, and Robert Rubin, Treasury secretary for President Clinton.
The three former Treasury secretaries all back a carbon tax that would put a price on greenhouse gas emissions. Their report comes as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, earlier this month, proposed a 30% cut in carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by 2030. Its findings forecasts huge economic losses:
Rising sea levels and storm surge damage are likely to lead to an extra $2 billion to $3.5 billion in property losses each year by 2030 in the Gulf Coast, Northeast and Southeast. By 2050, from $66 billion to $106 billion worth of existing coastal property will likely be below sea level nationwide, growing to $238 billion to $507 billion by 2100.
Extreme heat -- especially in the Southwest, Southeast and Upper Midwest -- will likely add 27 to 50 extra days each year when temperatures hit at least 95 by mid-century. By 2100, this  will likely reach 45 to 100 additional days. It will make being outside so difficult, labor productivity could drop, while  air conditioning demand will require the construction of more power plants, raising electricity costs.
Global warming could benefit  farmers in the upper Great Plains by extending the growing season, but their gains will be offset by losses in the Midwest and South. Without major adaptation, national crop production (corn, soy, wheat and cotton) could decline by 4% by mid-century and up to 42% by late century. 



Glaciers melt, trees die at parks; Evidence is everywhere, Interior chief says


Interior Secretary Sally Jewell says she sees the impact of climate change at just about every national park she visits.
"In Historic Jamestowne, we've actually had 98 feet of coastline wash away, including half of what was a Civil War fort and some very critical Native American artifacts that have been there probably for 10,000 years," Jewell says. "Glaciers melting in Glacier National Park; Joshua trees dying in Joshua Tree National Park -- and all these things are tied in to a changing climate."
As the Fourth of July holiday approaches -- when many Americans head outdoors to camp, hike and barbecue -- Jewell cites two 21st-century challenges for the national park system she oversees. One is to engage a younger generation that may be more interested in the digital world than the natural one. The other is to respond to the changing landscape caused by climate change.
"We're going to have to triage," she said Monday on Capital Download. "We're going to have to say, what is climate change likely to do, and can we save these historic resources, these cultural resources, these landscapes? Or do we have to put our money, which is limited, into places that are less likely to be impacted?
"These are really difficult decisions, because the mission of the National Park Service is to leave these national treasures unimpaired for future generations, and yet with climate change we're having to make some hard choices."
Jewell, 58, spoke to USA TODAY's weekly video newsmaker series in her sprawling office, its balcony offering a panoramic view of the Capitol, the Washington Monument and the Jefferson Memorial. Last year, she took over the department that oversees public lands, national parks and Indian affairs without much of a background in politics. A former petroleum engineer and CEO of REI, an outdoor gear company, she says she has gotten an education in how Washington works -- and how it doesn't.
"We're in the forever business," she says. "Our charge in national parks is to preserve them unimpaired for future generations, but we are funded lurching from continuing resolution to continuing resolution." That is different from the business world she left.
"People accuse businesses of having a short-term mentality, but I'll tell you, businesses do strategic planning, and they think forward," something she says is "very difficult" to do in Washington. Another contrast: "In the private sector, you're rewarded for taking risks. In the public sector, you take risks and you're wrong, and people will hammer you. So it makes you very risk-averse."
She expresses little patience with those who argue the climate isn't changing or debate whether humans are causing the change.
"I would say that the science is clear, but whether or not you choose to think about the causes of climate change, all you have to do is open your eyes and look around you to see that climate change is real," she says. "So we can no longer pretend it's going to go away. We have to adapt and deal with it." 



The late Democratic senator and all-around sage Daniel Patrick Moynihan put it best: "Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts."
There have been, are and always will be plenty of issues to argue about. What's the best way to improve the economy? How do we solve the immigration crisis? What should we do about (insert international flashpoint)? What's so good about goodbye?
But there are also things that just are. Night follows day. The world is round, not flat. Brazil is really, really disappointed.
Which brings us to the BBC Trust and climate change.
The Trust, which oversees Britain's prestigious public broadcasting operations, recently issued a report chastising the Beeb's journalists for devoting entirely too much time and attention to climate change deniers.
Since 2010, the BBC has provided training to staffers to help them do a better job of covering science properly. But apparently the lessons haven't sunk in.
The report found that thanks to the "over-rigid application of editorial guidelines on impartiality," the BBC continues to give "undue attention to marginal opinion" when it comes to climate change and other scientific concerns.
"The key point the workshops tried to impart is that impartiality in science coverage does not simply lie in reflecting a wide range of views, which may result in a 'false balance,'" the report said. "More crucially it depends on the varying degree of prominence such views should be given. In this respect, editorial decisions should be guided by where the scientific consensus might be found on any given topic, if it can in fact be determined."
That, of course doesn't mean freezing out dissenting voices. But it also doesn't mean you should give equal space or airtime to established truth on the one hand and reality-challenged people who don't like it on the other.
And climate change is a classic example. There is an overwhelming consensus among scientists that human activities are causing global warming.
But it's hardly the only example. The BBC Trust report shines a bright light on a problem that continues to haunt journalism, not just on science stories and not just across the pond.
No matter what many believe, most journalists endeavor to be fair. In that effort, there's a tendency to print what someone says, print what the other side says and call it a day.
The trouble is, there isn't always equal merit on both sides. So, in instances where one side is largely fact-based, and the other is spouting obvious nonsense, treating both sides equally isn't balanced. It's misleading.
Often journalists are reluctant to state the conclusions that stem from their reporting, out of the concern that they will appear partisan or biased. But just laying out both positions without going further in an effort to establish the truth can create the false balance that the BBC Trust is so worried about. And that doesn't do much good for the readers and the viewers.
Among the worst offenders are cable and the Sunday morning network public affairs shows, where the default position is to get two people on opposite sides of an issue and let them duke it out. The result is often fireworks at the expenses of enlightenment.
One healthy development has been the rise of fact-checking in American journalism. Huge props go to two outfits that do it for a living: FactCheck.org, an initiative of the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center, launched in 2003, and PolitiFact, started by the Tampa Bay Times in 2007.
Both give in-depth examinations to the pronouncements of public officials and assess their veracity. Other outlets have embraced the cause, and PolitiFact has entered partnerships with local news organizations.
What's critical is that conclusions are based on facts, not the outlook of the reporter.
Journalism isn't stenography. It's not treating everything the same when it's not the same. It's about giving citizens information about public affairs that is as accurate as possible. (Well, it's also about Justin Bieber and the Kardashians -- now there's a rock group name -- but that's a different column.)
Thanks to the BBC Trust for giving us that healthy reminder. 




Firefighting costs soar amid warming; Since 1985, spending has risen nearly fourfold






The costs of fighting wildfires are rising dramatically, and could keep climbing in the face of climate change that's contributing to longer fire seasons out West and the spread of housing developments near forests, a science group warned Wednesday.
"The annual suppression cost has exceeded $1 billion in each year since 2000," said Rachel Cleetus, senior climate economist with the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) in  a phone conference with reporters.
But the actual damage costs -- when including lost tourism revenue, the harm caused to public health and expenses related to watershed damage -- can dwarf firefighting costs, she added.
The report comes as the largest wildfire in Washington-state history continues to blaze, and  26 fires are burning almost a million acres in the western U.S.  Nationally, wildfires have burned less than half the 10-year average so far this summer.
The report  noted  that since 1985, fire-suppression costs have increased nearly fourfold from $440 million (in 2012 dollars) to more than $1.7 billion in 2013.
Additionally, climate change is the dominant driver of  fires in the West, says Jason Funk, a UCS climate scientist. "Temperatures have risen in the West by 2 degrees since 1970," and the wildfire season has grown  from five months to seven, he said.
He also said the average number of big western fires has risen from about 140 per year in the 1980s to 250 in the 2000s.
Another problem, said  Ray Rasker,  executive director of Headwaters Economics,  is that  60% of  new homes built  since 1990 are in high-fire-risk "wildland-urban interface" areas.
Overall, the UCS report found that more than 1.2 million homes across 13 western states are at high or very high risk of wildfires. These properties have a combined estimated value of nearly $190 billion, with 80% of the properties at the highest risk  in California, Colorado and Texas.
While local governments may approve the development of these new homes, it's the state and especially, federal governments that are stuck with the bills  to protect these homes from wildfires.
Most federal fire-suppression costs are borne by the U.S. Forest Service. The Department of the Interior picks up the remainder.
But with only about $1 billion budgeted for fighting fires, the Forest Service will likely once again have to tap other funds, such as forest-thinning projects, to  fight fires.
Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell testified  this month that while the government has the money to combat about 99% of  wildfires, it needs a stable funding source to pay for the biggest blazes, the remaining 1%, that  take 30% of his agency's budget.

 Obama is seeking to expand this spending and broaden the scope of the administration's climate activities. The most aggressive of these actions is the president's proposed clean power plan, which seeks to limit carbon dioxide emissions from our nation's power plants.
Obama's own Environmental Protection Agency admits it will cost billions of dollars per year and raise energy prices for consumers. Obliterating the coal industry will also cost thousands of jobs in Kentucky and across America.
The Obama administration fully understands that unilateral climate action will have little impact. As former EPA administrator Lisa Jackson told my subcommittee, "We will not ultimately be able to change the amount of carbon dioxide that is accumulating in the atmosphere alone."
Current EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy testified last fall that her agency does not measure whether its regulations will actually affect climate change; it is simply part of an "overall strategy" to demonstrate global leadership.
While U.S. energy-related carbon emissions have fallen to their lowest level in nearly two decades, emissions in China are at an all-time high and continue to rise. In fact, China emits more carbon dioxide in one month than the maximum amount EPA's proposal would reduce in one year.
In sum, the president's climate plan amounts to all pain for American consumers and China's gain. While President Obama continues to spend tens of billions of dollars and seek to hamstring our economy, China and other countries abroad are poised to take advantage of our competitive weakness.
Rep. Ed Whitfield, R-Ky., is chairman of the House Energy and Power Subcommittee. 

scientific evidence of human-caused climate change growing stronger all the time, advocates of inaction have turned to another argument: It's pointless for the U.S. to limit emissions of greenhouse gases, they say, because increases from other nations -- particularly China -- will overwhelm any U.S. reductions.
It's true that unilateral U.S. action can't save the planet. The United States accounts for about 16% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions. By itself, the Obama administration's controversial plan to cut emissions from existing power plants, unveiled in June, would barely make a dent in the global total.
China, meanwhile, surpassed the U.S. in 2006 to become the leading emitter of carbon dioxide. It produces 29% of global carbon dioxide emissions and burns half the world's coal.
That makes China's coal consumption the most important factor in setting the world's thermostat. To keep any hope alive of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), scientists say, China's carbon emissions must peak by the mid-2020s.
There's no guarantee that will happen. Energy-hungry China has been gobbling up worldwide coal reserves to fuel its economic growth. But it's not true, as the do-nothing crowd in the USA argues, that the Chinese have no interest at all in reducing their dependence on coal. Their reasons just happen to be more domestic than global.
For one thing, coal burned in power plants and elsewhere is a main source of the smog that frequently shrouds Beijing and other cities. Chinese authorities regard air pollution as a major problem that threatens public health and invites social unrest.
Thanks to a popular new mobile phone app developed by Chinese environmentalist Ma Jun, people can now monitor pollution levels hourly in 190 cities.  In several cities and provinces, China is already experimenting with carbon-pricing schemes that resemble the "cap and trade" systems the U.S. Congress has refused to approve. China is also making big bets on solar panels and wind turbines -- again, not primarily because of global warming, but because it sees renewable energy as a growing sector that it wants to dominate.
Taking a long view, Chinese leaders see the threats posed by rising sea levels, droughts and other effects of climate change.
For all these reasons, China is considering its first mandatory cap on coal use. Whether that will happen, or be sufficient, remains uncertain. Sustaining economic growth that has lifted a million people out of poverty remains China's overriding priority. Signals of its intentions could emerge at climate talks next month in New York, in December in Peru and next year in Paris.
That's where the United States comes in. As the two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, China and America hold the key on global warming.
If the U.S. acts to curb emissions, it puts pressure on China to go along. If it doesn't, it gives China an excuse to delay. Thanks to the Obama administration's plans, White House counselor John Podesta says, during the latest discussions with the Chinese "we didn't have to hear lectures about what we weren't doing." 

nese inaction as an excuse for ignoring global warming is a mistake, a USA TODAY editorial argued, because China has begun addressing its environmental problems.
Everyone is always saying the United States should lead by example.
I guess they don't mean  in regard to the environment. Meanwhile, we will drag our feet on becoming a leader in the technology needed to address climate change, while China and the rest of the world pass us by because we are controlled to a large extent by the coal and fossil fuel lobby and its politicians/puppets.
Mark Smith
USA TODAY's editorial states, "if the U.S. acts to curb emissions, it puts pressure on China to go along" ("China, U.S. fight over the world's thermostat," Our view, Climate change debate, Monday).
Or the Chinese could look at how Environmental Protection Agency regulations are hindering businesses in the United States and take advantage of a declining American economy to boost production and fill the void.
Douglas Miller
If anything, U.S. environmental moves will dissuade Chinese leaders from doing anything. They're not as keen to commit economic suicide as U.S. leaders seem to be.
Braxton Deal
The future of energy is renewable. Maybe coal and oil will take us past the century, but powering our future depends on other sources. The longer we bury our heads in the sand and sacrifice our future, the better chance China has to control future energy production. This will be the next revolution.
David Rozas
There is widespread agreement in the scientific community that man's activities are the cause of climate change and that catastrophic changes will occur if we don't act soon. The only debate should be regarding how we should act.
Unfortunately, the oil and coal interests are funneling money  to promote climate denial  in a campaign spreading ignorance. That is making it difficult.
Tom Johnson
The real, long-term answer is to use nuclear power plants, which have advanced significantly over the last few decades.
Michael Conn
Coal-powered energy belongs in the past
Letters
In the commentary  "America's pain is China's gain," Rep. Ed Whitfield, R-Ky., demonstrates a lack of economic insight, even within his own state (Opposing view, Climate change debate).
According to a 2010 Harvard study, "Full cost accounting for the life cycle of coal,"  pollutants from coal add to the price of energy, costing the United States up to half-a-trillion dollars or more annually.
A 2011 study, "Environmental accounting for pollution in the United States economy,"  states that coal's external costs are 2.2 times more costly to the U.S. than any economic benefits from coal.
Additionally, a 2009 report from the Mountain Association for Community Economic Development, "The impact of coal on the Kentucky state budget," states that coal provides an estimated $528 million in annual Kentucky state revenue; yet, that income does not offset the $643 million Kentucky spends on coal-related infrastructure and tax preferences for a net impact of negative $115 million.
Burning coal is economically irresponsible.

The Obama administration is likely to use upcoming climate talks to push for a treatyless accord that would "name and shame" countries into reducing  heat-trapping carbon emissions.
Faced with a Congress that has balked at fighting climate change, U.S. negotiators are not expected to seek a  legally binding treaty  requiring Senate ratification. Instead, they're more apt to seek emission-cutting pledges from major polluters such as China.
"I believe there will be a pledge-and-review agreement" that would be politically but not legally binding, says Paul Bledsoe, a senior climate change official in the Clinton administration who has talked to the Obama White House. "It's kind of what the U.S. has done the last five years," says Bledsoe, now a senior fellow in climate and energy issues at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. In 2009, President Obama made an international pledge to cut U.S. emissions 17% from 2005 levels by 2020.
The United Nations is holding a climate summit Sept. 23 in New York  to advance another round of U.N. talks in December in Lima, Peru, that are slated to yield a  climate agreement next year in Paris. As part of the negotiations, the Obama administration will sidestep Congress by seeking a political accord rather than a global treaty, The New York Times reported Wednesday, saying it wants to avoid another Kyoto failure. In 1997, the U.N. signed a climate  treaty in Kyoto, Japan, that the U.S. Senate never ratified.
State Department spokesman Jen Psaki declined to describe the U.S. approach. "Not a word of the new climate agreement currently under discussion has been written, so it is entirely premature to say whether it will or won't require Senate approval," she said.
Yet, climate experts say Obama has little choice. "Realistically what else is he going to do?" says Vicki Arroyo, executive director of the non-partisan Georgetown Climate Center, noting his inability to get the two-thirds majority needed to ratify a treaty. 



California's 100-year drought; Fierce fires, agricultural losses -- severe water shortage a 'threat to civilization'


California is in the third year of one of the state's worst droughts in the past century, one that's led to fierce wildfires, water shortages and restrictions and potentially staggering agricultural losses.
The dryness in California is only part of a longer-term, 15-year drought across most of the Western USA, one that bioclimatologist Park Williams said is notable because "more area in the West has persistently been in drought during the past 15 years than in any other 15-year period since the 1150s and 1160s" -- that's more than 850 years ago.
"When considering the West as a whole, we are currently in the midst of a historically relevant megadrought," said Williams, a professor at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University in New York.
Megadroughts are what Cornell University scientist Toby Ault calls the "great white sharks of climate: powerful, dangerous and hard to detect before it's too late. They have happened in the past, and they are still out there, lurking in what is possible for the future, even without climate change." Ault goes so far as to call megadroughts "a threat to civilization."
WHAT IS A MEGADROUGHT?
Megadroughts are defined  more by their duration than their severity. They are  extreme dry spells that can last for a decade or longer, says  research meteorologist Martin Hoerling of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Megadroughts have parched the West, including present-day California, long before Europeans settled the region in the 1800s.
Most of the USA's droughts of the past century, even the infamous 1930s Dust Bowl that forced migrations of Oklahomans and others from the Plains,  "were exceeded in severity and duration multiple times by droughts during the preceding 2,000 years," the National Climate Assessment reported this year.
The difference now, of course, is the Western USA is home to more than 70 million people who weren't here for previous megadroughts.  The implications are far more daunting.
Overall, "the nature of the beast is that drought is cyclical, and these long periods of drought have been commonplace in the past," says  Mark Svoboda, a climatologist at the National Drought Mitigation Center in Lincoln, Neb. "We are simply much more vulnerable today than at any time in the past. People can't just pick up and leave to the degree they did in the past."
Ault agrees that this long-term Western dry spell could be classified as a megadrought. "But this is not as bad as it could get."
How do scientists know how wet or dry it was centuries ago? Though no weather records exist before the late 1800s, scientists can examine  "proxy data," such as tree rings and lake sediment, to find out how much -- or little -- rain fell hundreds or even thousands of years ago. Tree rings are wider during wet years and narrower during dry years.
"Prolonged droughts -- some of which lasted more than a century -- brought thriving civilizations, such as the ancestral Pueblo (Native Americans) of the Four Corners region, to starvation, migration and finally collapse," Lynn Ingram, a geologist at the University of California-Berkeley, wrote in her recent book The West Without Water.
Ault says decade-long droughts happen once or twice a century in the Western USA, but much worse droughts, ones that last for a century or more, occur every 500 years or so.
Has California reached megadrought status? Not yet: "This one wouldn't stand out as a megadrought," Hoerling said. Even so, "this is the state's worst consecutive three years for precipitation in 119 years of records," he said.
As of Aug. 28, 100% of the state of California was considered to be in a drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. More than 58% is in "exceptional" drought, the worst level. Record warmth has fueled the drought as the state sees its hottest year since records began in 1895, the National Climatic Data Center reports.
Statewide emergency
Because of the dryness, Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown declared a statewide  emergency this year. Since then, reservoir storage levels have continued to drop, and as of late August, they were down to about 59% of the historical average.
Regulations restricting outdoor water use were put in place in July for the entire state.  People aren't allowed to hose down driveways and sidewalks, nor are they allowed to water lawns and landscapes (if there is excess runoff).  There are reports of wells running dry in central California.
About 1,000 more wildfires than usual have charred the state.
The drought is likely to inflict  $2.2 billion in losses on the agricultural industry, according to a July study from the University of California-Davis.
"If California suffered something like a multi-decade drought," University of Arizona climate scientist Gregg Garfin said, "the best-case scenario would be some combination of conservation, technological improvements (such as desalinization plants), multi-state cooperation on the drought, economic-based water transfers from agriculture to urban areas and other things like that to get humans through the drought.
"But there would be consequences for ecosystems and agriculture," he said.
"In the worst-case scenario, there might be out-migration and/or ghost towns," Garfin said.
If the drought worsened, "we'd have to learn how to use water more efficiently," Ault said. "This is a glimpse of the future."
ROLE OF CLIMATE CHANGE
What role does climate change play in this or future droughts?
Scientists such as Hoerling and Ault say they don't have the tools to tease out how much of this specific drought might be attributed to climate change.
"As of now, probably very little of the California drought can be attributed to climate change with any certainty," said tree-ring scientist Edward Cook of Lamont-Doherty.
Overall, past droughts have probably been due to subtle changes in water temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Cooler water temperatures -- known as La Ni�as -- tend to produce drier conditions in the West.
Hoerling noted that computer models from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  show that California could actually see more, not less, winter rain and snow because of climate change. However, overall rising temperatures would tend to favor more droughts, University of Arizona scientist Jonathan Overpeck said.
What's troubling is that the 20th century -- during which time California's population  increased from about 1.5 million to almost 40 million -- may well have been an outlier, an unusually wet century: "Overall, the 20th century experienced less drought than most of the preceding four to 20 centuries," a study in the journal Science said.
Ault continues to investigate the relationship between climate change and megadroughts and the likelihood that an even more severe megadrought might hit in the next hundred years in the Southwest -- one that's worse than any other drought in the past 1,000 years.
Because of global warming, Ault says, the chances of the Southwest experiencing a decade-long drought is at least 50% (but may be closer to 80%-90%), and the chances of a three-decade-long megadrought range from 20% to 50% over the next century. "For the Southwestern U.S., I'm not optimistic about avoiding real megadroughts," Ault said. "As we add greenhouse gases into the atmosphere -- and we haven't put the brakes on stopping this -- we are weighting the dice for megadrought conditions.
"The risks would be lower if we didn't warm the planet as much as is expected to occur, but they aren't zero, because we know these things happen naturally," he said.
"Megadroughts are a threat to civilization," he told an American Geophysical Union conference this year. "They could possibly be even worse than anything experienced by any humans who have lived in that part of the world for the last few thousand years."

Climate change is a life issue; Pro-life Christians linking healthy environment and human viability


This is not a column dedicated to bludgeoning those unmoved by liberals' warnings about climate change. It is an invitation to people, especially Christians, to think about what's happening to the water, and what will happen to us if there's not enough of it to go around.
For whatever reason, 58% of California is in "exceptional drought," which is even worse than "extreme." Also in the headlines: a tap-water drinking ban in Toledo, Ohio, precipitated by Lake Erie algae blooms that researchers attribute, in part, to  warmer temperatures.
These and similar phenomena are more than a boutique concern for silly liberals. If you care about life -- and I know you do, especially if you're a Christian who believes in  the sanctity of life -- please pay attention to what is happening with the water.
In California's Central Valley, the rich bounty of agricultural products is in jeopardy as the water becomes scarcer. People are rightly worrying about what they are going to drink if the drought goes on. If this isn't a "life" issue, it's hard to say what is.
A worldwide problem
The United Nations "Water for Life" campaign warns that water scarcity is one of the main problems staring down the world of the 21st century. "Even without climate change," says Peter Brabeck, the chairman of Nestl�, "we are running out of water."
One of the environmental movement's biggest mistakes has been to give the impression  that enviros care more about old trees and rare animals than human beings. That problem, thankfully, is being remedied  as a new ethos in the movement connects the dots between a healthy environment and the viability of human life.
Meanwhile, more theologically conservative Christians are breaking out of an old "lordship over the earth" way of thinking  and embracing "creation care" as a religious imperative, notes Christian Piatt, author of the new book postChristian.  Typifying this evangelical ethic is ministry leader Randy Alcorn, who touts his anti-abortion commitment  but adds, "I am also concerned about the welfare of the environment God has entrusted to our care, in which ... human lives are also at stake." Alcorn's statement appears in Gardening Eden, a book by evangelical Michael Abbat�.
Nothing against polar bears, but it's not about them primarily. The issue is the life-threatening impact on human beings as parts of our habitat become less able to support human life.
Biblical implications
Water has deep resonance with Christians. That includes the spiritual "living water" of Christ as well as the actual stuff, which many  missionary travelers help secure through well-digging in less developed countries.
Fish likewise feature in the Bible -- and in today's climate analyses. Warmer ocean waters, in tandem with overfishing and seawater acidification, threaten this important source of food. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that the changes will likely "increase the vulnerability of human societies, by affecting income, employment and food security."
When the weather goes wild, people die. The science does not back the oft-made connection between climate change and the severity of the tornadoes we have endured in recent years. But the IPCC says climate trends will likely supersize tropical cyclones in the future, taking wind speeds and rainfall levels from bad to worse. It hardly needs to be pointed out that the coastal zones, vulnerable to typhoons, tend to be high-population areas.
Lately, because of political controversies and headline-grabbing court cases such as the Supreme Court Hobby Lobby decision, the public's view of evangelical reverence for life has been reduced mainly to fetuses and fertilized eggs. In truth, evangelicals are addressing myriad threats to life, from poverty and slavery to genocide. If the life movement can devote itself to fighting these, can't it also confront the threat to our life-giving water -- and compel the small- and large-scale actions that will conserve it for human beings today and tomorrow?
I have been around enough Christians to know there is room in their hearts, and on their agenda, for this life issue, too.

Companies to make climate pledges at U.N. summit; Investors' voices join chorus calling for action on emissions


Touted as the world's largest gathering ever on climate change, this week's U.N. Climate Summit  will be as much about business as politics.
Major companies, including Big Oil, will pledge to help fight global warming by cutting their heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions, protecting forests and reducing methane leakage from fossil fuel production.
They're getting nudged to act, not just by tens of thousands of climate marchers who clogged Manhattan streets Sunday -- some dressed as polar bears and others carrying signs that read, "Go Solar," "Fracking=Death" and "There Is No Planet B" -- but by investors demanding action.
The result will be a climate extravaganza unlike any before. "This is very different. It's not just policy leaders," says Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a non-profit group that promotes sustainability. There's an "unprecedented" number of companies, investors and finance ministers involved, she says.
"It's a very, very positive sign," Todd Stern, U.S. special envoy for climate change, said in a White House briefing last week.  "Business is increasingly focused on trying to, in some cases, be part of the clean energy revolution."
Today, one day before the summit, Archbishop Desmond Tutu is slated to announce new fossil fuel divestment. Hundreds of wealthy individuals and at least 50 foundations will pledge to divest any holdings in the world's top 200 oil and gas producers, including ExxonMobil, BP and Chevron.
"It's a snowballing movement," says Stephen Heintz, president of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, which is signing on. His fund is controlled by a family whose fortune was made in the oil industry.
That's not all.
About two dozen large companies will join environmental groups and 24 countries to stop deforestation, which can exacerbate global warming by releasing more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. They'll commit not to source products -- including palm oil, soy and beef -- from land where forests have been recently or illegally cut down.  They'll join Nestle, Kellogg's, Hershey's and General Mills, which have already pledged action.
"It's a good news story I never would have predicted," says Charles McNeill, a senior policy adviser for the United Nations Development Program.
Six of the world's largest oil and gas companies will commit, via a new partnership with the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, to take steps to reduce methane leaks in fossil fuel production.
"This is an enormous opportunity" for the industry, says Nathaniel Keohane of the Environmental Defense Fund, a private group. He says emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, account for 25% of global warming.
World Bank President Jim Yong Kim will unveil a growing list of companies and cities that, like his organization, support a price on carbon. Advocates say that taxing fossil fuels such as oil and coal, which emit carbon when burned, will increase investments in energy efficiency and renewable power.
Last week, more than 340 global institutional investors with at least $24 trillion in assets -- including Swiss Re and the Unitarian Universalist Association -- called on government leaders to adopt carbon pricing. The European Union has done so, but the United States has not.
We Mean Business, a coalition working with thousands of companies and investors, will launch with a report on increasing business support for low-carbon energy. It holds a discussion today between top U.N. climate negotiator Christiana Figueres and the leaders of two companies that have pledged to get all their power from renewable sources: Apple's Tim Cook and Ikea's Peter Agnefj�ll.
Dozens of climate-related events will take place this week in the Big Apple, but the summit itself occurs Tuesday at U.N. headquarters. President Obama and leaders from more than 120 countries are likely to announce climate initiatives, and company CEOs will participate in talks or make their own commitments.
"We're taking this summit seriously, both to show that the United States is committed to leading the fight against climate change and to call on other leaders to step up to the plate," says John Podesta, Obama's counselor.
He says Obama will outline U.S. efforts but will not make a new emissions-cutting pledge until early next year.
In 2009, at U.N. climate talks in Copenhagen, Obama pledged to reduce U.S. emissions by 17%, from 2005 levels, by 2020 -- a goal the country is largely on course to meet.
The leaders of China and India, the world's first- and third-largest emitters of carbon dioxide, will not attend.
Podesta says China's vice premier and India's prime minister will meet with Obama a few days later in Washington.
The summit will get a dose of Hollywood. Actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio, chosen as a U.N. Messenger of Peace, will speak.
"I feel a moral obligation to speak out at this key moment in human history," he said in a statement.
Though the event is not part of formal U.N. climate negotiations, it's aimed at creating momentum for a new global accord to be signed next year in Paris. Prior U.N. agreements have not reduced global carbon emissions, which continue to rise mostly because of economic development in Asia.
Figueres, the U.N. negotiator, says net carbon emissions will need to be slashed to zero in the second half of this century to keep a global temperature rise under 2 degrees Celsius (or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).
Heintz says his fund, the legacy of John D. Rockefeller, may signal a shift in U.S. attitudes. It  devotes half its grants to promoting renewable power and climate research.
He says Rockefeller believed in innovation and in founding Standard Oil, he put an older industry -- whale oil -- out of business. "I'm convinced that if he  were alive today," Heintz says, "he'd be looking out to the future and investing in clean energy technology." 




Europe sets lofty goal: Cut carbon output 40%; Commission looks to deliver by 2030; meanwhile, U.S. efforts slip


At the U.N. Climate Summit, the European Commission will formally recommend a 40% cut in heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 for its 28 member countries, its president said Monday.
"It's ambitious, but I believe it's achievable," EC President Jose Manuel Barroso said in a USA TODAY interview in advance of today's  summit. He said he's confident that Europe's countries, which have been slashing emissions, will approve this new reduction -- from 1990 levels -- at a meeting next month.
Leaders of more than 120 countries, including President Obama, will announce their efforts to fight global warming -- as will many major companies -- at what's expected to be the largest climate meeting ever. Their pledges aim to build momentum for a new global climate accord to be announced next year during U.N. climate talks in Paris.
The one-day summit, preceded by a historic march that drew tens of thousands of climate activists to Manhattan streets Sunday, comes as scientists report that global greenhouse gas emissions rose 2.3% last year to record levels. In the U.S., after several recent years of decline, they rose 2.9%.
"This is an enormous challenge. And this is why the United States is prepared to take the lead in order to bring other nations to the table," Secretary of State John Kerry said Monday, committing to make it "front and center in all of our diplomatic efforts."
He said cutting carbon emissions is a "win-win-win," because it delivers health and other benefits.
Corporate leaders made the same pitch. "If you innovate and set the bar high, you can do both," Apple CEO Tim Cook said at a climate event, referring to profits and sustainability. "We need to be a pebble in the pond that creates the ripple," he said noting that renewable energy already powers 94% of Apple's corporate facilities worldwide.
"They're good business decisions," said Jose Lopez, head of Nestle's global operations, about the company's halving of factory emissions in the last 10 years and its efforts to ensure products don't come from illegally deforested land. Citing water scarcity in Mexico, he said Nestle is opening its first dairy factory there next month that will use water extracted from milk to cover operations.
"We need to find solutions, because we need to continue to feed the planet," Lopez told USA TODAY. What's different now, he said, is that his company -- like others -- is sharing its experiences and working with U.N. officials and non-governmental groups. "Silos are falling down," he said.
World Bank President Jim Yong Kim announced that a thousand companies and 73 countries -- including China, Russia and the European Union -- support putting a price or tax on fossil fuels to boost investments in cleaner energy. "Today we see real momentum," he said, noting the governments represent almost half the world's population.
Barroso said the EU, which his commission represents, is on track to meet its earlier pledge of cutting its 1990 carbon emissions 20% by 2020. He said it has done so while growing its economies, proving it's possible to do both. He outlined the new 40% cut earlier this year and is now putting it forward for an EU vote. He spoke at the New York Stock Exchange shortly after ringing the trading bell.
Still, he said the EU's emissions now account for only 11% of global ones, so the world's biggest polluters -- China, the United States and India -- need to step up to the plate.
"President Obama's plan clearly goes in the right direction," Barroso said, referring to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's proposal this past June to cut carbon emissions from existing power plants 30% -- from 2005 levels -- by 2030. Obama has also boosted fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks.
"China is doing much more than it was doing before," he said as well, adding global warming has caused serious air pollution in its cities and has become "a real social problem" there.
Still, Barroso said China should do more. He said it has resisted binding global agreements. Obama administration officials have also indicated they're open to a political accord rather than a legally binding treaty that Congress is unlikely to ratify.
"The agreement needs to have legal force," Barroso said, adding companies need to know "what the legal framework will be." 




Millennials key to climate change, Gore says; Initiative urges them to confront leaders, ask 'Why? Why Not?'


Al Gore is synonymous with global climate change -- and has been richly rewarded for his efforts. A Nobel Peace Prize. Grammy. Emmy. Subject of the Academy Award-winning documentary An Inconvenient Truth.
Add Millennial recruiter to the former vice president's r�sum�.
Today, when world leaders gather for the opening session of the United Nations' Climate Summit in New York, Gore will urge young people worldwide to demand action. His initiative, Why? Why Not?, part of the Climate Reality Project, is designed to build support for a binding international agreement on greenhouse gas reductions at the United Nations Convention in Paris in late 2015.
The campaign runs in eight countries -- the USA, China, India, Australia, South Africa, Brazil, Canada and the Philippines -- says Ken Berlin, CEO of the Climate Reality Project.
In an interview with USA TODAY, Gore described the campaign.
Q: What is Why? Why Not?
A: The climate crisis is the greatest challenge we have ever faced. We are already seeing its consequences around the world: stronger storms, bigger floods and mudslides, deeper droughts, worsening fires, hotter temperatures, spreading tropical diseases, melting ice and rising seas. These events are all projected to get worse in coming years unless we stop using the atmosphere as an open sewer for the 98 million tons of global-warming pollution that we pour into it every day. Young people have the most at stake, and young people have always been in the vanguard of great social movements. So it is critical that we involve today's youth in the battle to halt the climate crisis.
We worked with (ad agency) WPP to develop a global awareness campaign to help youth confront global leaders, and ask, "Why? Why Not?" in an online video. In every language on the planet, children ask these questions -- Why, Why Not? -- over and over. They ask the first to understand the world around them, and they ask the second when they want to change that world.
The results have been inspiring. Thousands of youth from across the globe have made their voices heard. We selected eight of the most compelling questions from the group to be the "Voices of Your Generation." Those winners will join me next week at the U.N. Climate Summit to deliver their questions to the world.
Q: How do you hope to engage Millennials?
A: Today's young people understand that the climate crisis is the greatest threat we face. It is irrevocably altering the world they will inherit so they have a vested interest in halting this global problem once and for all. Unfortunately, young people often feel powerless to make major change. We wanted to help give the leaders of tomorrow a voice today. To achieve this goal, the Climate Reality Project worked with WPP to create a tool to allow the digital generation to ask direct questions of global leaders. The result is Why? Why Not?
Q: What type of tech (social media, cloud computing, etc.) will you use to engage younger people?
A: Social media can foster, grow and amplify the youth voice on a global scale. Today, over 1 billion people are on Facebook. YouTube receives 1 billion unique visitors per month. More than 75 million people use Instagram every single day. These tools are ubiquitous and allow young people to speak directly to each other and world leaders. Why? Why Not? harnesses the power of social media to direct the youth voice and ensure that their message is delivered.
Q: Do you believe Millennials are important to creating this social movement now that we are so interconnected, all day, via Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.?
A: Absolutely. As digital natives, today's youth understand the powerful potential of social media for action. What starts as a debate on Facebook can quickly spread around the world, across social media networks, and eventually influence world policy. By harnessing this potential with Why? Why Not? we are able to deliver a powerful message to world leaders -- it's time to solve the climate crisis. ...  It's time for our leaders to act. 




Managing waste and water has a bright future; Q: How can I profit from global warming?


A: The fact the planet is heating up is undeniable. Pundits and scientists disagree on the reasons, but investors just want to know how to profit.
Such a macro change in the environment will have untold ripple effects. But investors trying to get ahead of this trend are looking at six key areas that are most likely to see the biggest changes, as expressed in the Motif Investing Climate Change investment.
Those areas are water and waste management, agriculture, renewable energy, energy efficiency, nuclear energy and energy storage.
Water and waste management stocks have the largest weighting in Motif's Climate Change Investment.
The stocks include energy firm Covanta Holding and Xylem. Covanta is in the business of turning garbage into power, a skill that could be very lucrative as the world looks to deal with global warming. Xylem is making a variety of technology to improve the availability of water.
On the agriculture front, the second biggest weighting in the Motif, Monsanto is on the list. The company is developing a variety of tools that farmers can use to deal with the possibility of higher temperatures and less water.
Big solar stocks, like First Solar, are also on the possible winners. 




Big business joins president's call-to-action on clim

At a historic summit that enlisted climate pledges from dozens of companies, President Obama called Tuesday on all United Nations members to support a pact to curb global warming, saying, "Nobody gets a pass."
"We can only succeed in combating climate change if we are joined in this effort by every nation, developed and developing alike," Obama told the U.N. General Assembly. "No nation can meet this global threat alone."
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon organized the day-long U.N. Climate Summit to build momentum for an international accord to be finalized during U.N. talks next year in Paris.
The summit drew representatives from more than 120 countries, but China and India -- the first- and third-largest emitters of heat-trapping greenhouse gases -- did not send their heads of state. The event comes as global emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases continue to rise despite U.N. agreements to reduce them.
"The climate is changing faster than our efforts to address it," Obama said, citing impacts such as "more frequent extreme weather events" such as floods and hurricanes and record-breaking temperatures.
He noted his administration's push to curb carbon emissions from power plants, develop non-polluting renewable power and increase the fuel efficiency of its vehicles.
"We will do our part, and we will help developing nations do theirs," he said, announcing technological assistance to countries most at risk. He said the USA and China, as the two largest emitters, have a "special responsibility" to lead.
The summit, which featured hours of speeches in various languages, drew climate commitments from countries and companies. Dozens of participants announced an unprecedented partnership aimed at halving the loss of the world's forests by 2020 and ending it by 2030.
The 32 countries, including the USA, and 39 major companies, including Wal-Mart and McDonald's, signed on to the "New York Declaration on Forests," signaling the vital role forests play in climate change. Trees store carbon dioxide and release the heat-trapping greenhouse gas to the atmosphere when they're cut down.
"There is no way to crack the climate issue without the forest issues," said Charles McNeill, senior environmental policy adviser for the U.N. Development Program. He said the pledges are voluntary but, because they're public, signatories won't want to back out.
If the goal is met, the United Nations estimates the impact would be equivalent to taking every car in the world off the road. The participants, including dozens of environmental and indigenous groups, pledged to restore more than 1 million square miles of forest worldwide by 2030. 




Obama: Unite against terror; President meets Iraqi leader; sanctions announced against 24 entities


The world is making progress on issues from human rights to global warming, President Obama said Wednesday, but all of that could be undone by the largest threat: extremist violence.
In his annual address to the United Nations, Obama urged all countries and religions -- especially Islam -- to reject the extremist ideologies that fuel bloodshed and threaten global stability.
"As we look to the future, one issue risks a cycle of conflict that could derail so much progress," Obama said. "And that is the cancer of violent extremism that has ravaged so many parts of the Muslim world."
The president's visit to the United Nations came the same week the United States began airstrikes in Syria against the Islamic State, one of the extremist groups cited by Obama. Attacks continued Wednesday. Last month, the president authorized similar strikes against the militant group in Iraq.
The escalation prompted some critics to question whether the United States is the right country to address the problems of global violence.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, speaking on CBS' This Morning, protested the attacks in Syria, saying, "No terrorist group can be eradicated and destroyed through aerial bombardments."
Addressing the General Assembly, Obama defended the Syria and Iraq airstrikes that have targeted the al-Qaeda-affiliated Khorasan group, as well as Islamic State positions.
Citing the Islamic State's record of violence, which includes beheadings of hostages, Obama told the delegates, "The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force."
Obama used the words "fanaticism," "hate" and "evil" to describe the Islamic State, condemning it as a "network of death."
The United States has assembled "a broad coalition" to defeat the militants, including Arab states, Obama said. He spoke of plans to train forces in Iraq and Syria to carry the fight on the ground against the Islamic State and other jihadists.
"We will neither tolerate terrorist safe havens, nor act as an occupying power," he said.
Obama's speech was in sharp contrast to his U.N. address last year. Then, he spoke of ending "a decade of war" that included Iraq and Afghanistan and having the United States shift away "from a perpetual war footing."
The threats of extremism dominated Obama's crowded schedule Wednesday, the second of three days of U.N. meetings. It included an Obama meeting with the new prime minister of Iraq and a special U.N. Security Council session devoted to the problem of "foreign fighters."
The council passed a resolution requiring countries to crack down on the recruitment of fighters who could move to other nations to launch attacks. That includes efforts to shut off financing for terrorist groups.
To that end, Obama's Treasury and State departments announced sanctions on 24 groups and individuals they say have aided the movement of foreign fighters.
Intelligence agencies estimate that more than 15,000 foreign fighters from 80 countries have traveled to training bases in Syria in recent years, Obama told the Security Council.
In calling on Muslims to denounce extremist ideology, Obama said a lethal group of terrorists "have perverted one of the world's great religions."
Thomas McDonnell, a professor of international law at Pace Law School in White Plains, N.Y., said it's commendable for Obama to speak out against global extremism.
The challenge, he said, is that many people around the world see the U.S. as a longtime backer of repressive regimes, especially in the Middle East.
"We are are not exactly a neutral arbiter," McDonnell said. "It's a complicated situation."
Citing criticism of the United States, Obama acknowledged the nation's faults, specifically last month's fatal shooting of an unarmed black man by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
Though "we have our own racial and ethnic tensions," Obama said, the United States has "worked to address our problems, to make our union more perfect."
Noting hopeful signs around the world, Obama said the prospects of major wars between global powers are reduced, poverty rates are falling and the Internet is helping to educate millions.
Obama also spoke of a "pervasive unease in our world" about events such as the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, Russian aggression in Ukraine -- and terrorism.
"We come together at a crossroads," he said. "Between war and peace, between disorder and integration, between fear and hope." 


A pair of massive protests in New York this week brought together climate change, Wall Street and the need for regulation as concern about the future of the planet melded with a sense that capitalism without rules poses an existential threat.
"None of this is rhetoric, and none of it is hysteria," is what no less a personality than actor Leonardo DiCaprio told world leaders assembled for the U.N. climate summit on Tuesday.
DiCaprio, who took part in the People's Climate March on Sunday that drew an estimated 300,000 protesters, addressed the group "not as an expert, but as a concerned citizen."
"As an actor I pretend for a living. I play fictitious characters often solving fictitious problems," DiCaprio said. "I believe humankind has looked at climate change in that same way: as if it were a fiction, happening to someone else's planet, as if pretending that climate change wasn't real would somehow make it go away."
After Sunday's March, a smaller protest on Monday, Flood Wall Street, resulted in more than a hundred arrests after protesters at the end of the day ignored police orders to disperse.
One of the speakers at Monday's protest, Canadian journalist Naomi Klein, has cast the debate over climate change as a clash between "deregulated capitalism" and the welfare of mankind in her new book, This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate, which was published last week.
"We have not done the things that are necessary to lower emissions because those things fundamentally conflict with deregulated capitalism," she writes in the book, "the reigning ideology for the entire period we have been struggling to find a way out of this crisis."
Of course Klein, author of an earlier book called Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism, is an avowed opponent of neoliberalism in general for what she sees as its pernicious effects on society, but that is not the reason she blames if for the lack of action on climate change.
"It's part of the same story, the same logic," she said on MSNBC last week. It is the result of an ideology, she says, "that values nothing but profit."
Effective action against climate change requires the type of government regulation that undermines the free market ideology currently driving companies, Wall Street, and -- to the extent that politicians are hostage to big-money interests -- Washington.
"We need to break a whole bunch of the free market rules that these guys hold very dear," she told Chris Hayes in the television interview. "We need to regulate."
This was DiCaprio's message to the U.N. assembly as well.
"To be clear, this is not about just telling people to change their light bulbs or to buy a hybrid car," the actor said. "This disaster has grown beyond the choices that individuals make. This is now about our industries, and governments around the world taking decisive, large-scale action."
Against this backdrop, at a time when airstrikes in Syria and an Ebola outbreak in Africa upstage the longer term crisis posed by climate change, President Obama's pledge at the U.N. to take account of climate change in U.S. development aid seemed woefully inadequate as a response.
Klein had anticipated this inadequacy in her Guardian column last week.
"It's not simply that our leaders aren't leading us -- at an appropriate gallop -- away from fossil fuels and towards the renewable energy revolution that is both technologically and economically feasible," she wrote.
"It's that most of them are doubling down on the very energy sources that are most responsible for the crisis, cheering on the extractive industries as they dig up the most greenhouse gas-intensive fossil fuels on the planet: oil from the tar sands, gas from fracking, extra-dirty lignite coal."
This is a fairly apt description of Obama, who never fails to boast in his State of the Union speeches about the U.S. boom in natural gas production from hydraulic fracturing, and whose administration has yet to take a stand on the Keystone XL pipeline that will support production of tar sands oil in Canada.
Given this inaction by government leaders, Klein says, people seek refuge in "mental tricks," finding excuses, grasping at potential technological fixes or simply putting their heads in the sand.
Whether the demonstrations in New York mark some sort of turning point in the climate change debate remains to be seen. But it has now been joined to the populist groundswell against rogue banks on Wall Street, the growing gap in inequality of incomes and opportunity, and resentment that corporate money has paralyzed Washington.
The type of revolution in government action needed to cope with climate change and other social ills is what threatens corporate interests the most and makes them so desperate in their opposition, Klein says, even though this change could bring numerous benefits to society.
"It's not the end of the world," she said of the needed government activism in her MSNBC interview. "It's the end of their world."
Darrell Delamaide has reported on business and economics from New York, Paris, Berlin and Washington. 



Bob Seger, the Midwestern meat-and-potatoes rock 'n' roller, is going worldly.
Ride Out, his first album in eight years, features familiar Seger themes of hope, honesty and moving forward. But it also is his most explicitly political work in years, tackling debt, gun violence and  Seger's  "No. 1 issue," climate change.
"I'm talking to the whole world this time," the singer/songwriter says from his work cabin 40 miles north of Detroit, where the walls are lined with guitars and a fridge is adorned with family photos.
Ride Out, out Tuesday,  is Seger's first album of new material since 2006's million-selling Face the Promise. A tour  kicks off Nov. 19 in Saginaw, Mich. It follows a run of live shows last year that saw Seger looking fresh and fit, the result of a new workout regimen and a cutback in his  cigarette habit.
The new album is the voice of a man who figures his own clock is ticking  while fretting about the world his son and daughter will inherit.
"When you're my age, you're very, very aware of your mortality," says Seger, who turns 70 in May.  "You start thinking, 'I've got to speak up before  I can't even get a record deal anymore.'"
The new material may be his most outspoken yet. Environmental matters dominate several new songs, most notably It's Your World, an ominous take on climate change that he knows could prove divisive.
"There may be a lot of people that won't come to the shows because of it," he says. "But I just feel it's something I've got to say."
Still, Ride Out is a diverse album,  from the Stevie Ray Vaughan-inspired Hey Gypsy  to the poignant fan tribute All of the Roads. It also features the majestic Gates of Eden, an account of spiritual awakening. Seger says friends and family have told him it's his best song in years.
He's a heavy reader, and one recent best seller -- Susan Cain's Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking -- inspired the song Listen for his 21-year-old son, Cole.
Seger wrote the tune when he and his wife, Nita, realized that "we're always giving our kids advice and interrupting them."
"As a parent, sometimes you think they're still 6," Seger says with a laugh, adding: "You never hear the truth if you don't listen." 




Meet the billionaire behind the Democrats; Tom Steyer a crusader against global warming
USA TODAY
October 15, 2014 Wednesday, CA CHASE EDITION





Tom Steyer, one of the biggest political donors of the midterm elections, said his multimillion-dollar crusade to slow global warming rests on exposing the human consequences of fossil-fuel consumption.
On a recent weekday, that quest took the California billionaire to a heavily industrial corner of southwest Detroit whose residents figure prominently in his campaign to disrupt American politics by making climate change a wedge issue in campaigns.
Sherry Griswold, who lives 600feet from the neighborhood's sprawling oil refinery, has appeared in an ad produced by Steyer's super PAC to influence the Michigan Senate race -- one of four competitive Senate contests the hedge-fund founder has targeted this year. He urged other residents to turn out on Election Day.
"The power that we have is the power to vote," he said to residents who gathered to meet with him at the Pine Grove Baptist Church.
Steyer and his NextGen Climate Action super PAC are engaged in an all-out fight to guarantee voters such as these will show up Nov. 4 to tip the balance in favor of Democrats struggling to maintain their majority in the U.S. Senate.
NextGen also invests in efforts to oust Republican governors in Maine, Florida and Pennsylvania and works to shape several state legislative races in California, Washington and Oregon.
In all, Steyer has plowed more than $42 million of his fortune into federal campaign accounts since early March 2013, making the San Francisco Democrat the largest super PAC donor of the 2014 election. His political organization has opened 40 offices, built a team of 800 employees and volunteers in its targeted states and made contact with more than 1.5 million voters.
Steyer has assembled an array of well-connected political strategists to advise him, including Chris Lehane, a former White House adviser to President Bill Clinton, and in Michigan, Amy Chapman,  who oversaw President Obama's successful  campaign in the state in 2008.
Steyer's goal is straightforward and ambitious: Get the United States "to transform its energy economy and to lead the world to transform its energy economy," he told USA TODAY during an interview in Detroit.
In addition to Michigan, NextGen has pumped money into crucial Senate contests in Iowa, Colorado and New Hampshire. Three weeks before the election, public polls show Democrats locked in tight races in Iowa and Colorado.
Steyer said he's "super optimistic" about Democrats' prospects and believes his group's voter outreach could make the difference.
"I'm very, very convinced of the rightness of what we are doing," he said.
Steyer's fortune -- pegged at $1.6 billion by Forbes -- and his evangelical zeal for his cause have quickly made him the country's biggest name in environmental activism. He has emerged as the leading Democratic counterweight to the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, who are at the center of a political network aiding conservatives. A single group tied to the Kochs, Americans for Prosperity, could spend $125 million in this election.
Along the way, Steyer has become a top target for Republicans who are quick to note that the hedge fund at the source of his vast wealth invested in the fossil fuel industry he denounces so fiercely.
MIDTERMS JUST THE START
During a whirlwind tour of Detroit, he met with the neighborhood activists, visited Griswold's home in the oil refinery's shadow and discussed policy with clean-energy advocates and executives.
He's eager to understand the ground game in Michigan -- where his team has spent more than $3 million.
Over a breakfast of scrambled eggs at a hotel restaurant in downtown Detroit, Steyer peppered Chapman and other strategists with questions. He wanted to know how many canvassers and staffers were at work in the state. Answer: 135. How many college campuses targeted? Eight.
The Michigan team has hit on nearly 49,000 doors, according to NextGen's state director, Stephanie Chang. The goal: Turn out young people, minorities and others more likely to side with Democrats but who might not head to the polls during a midterm election.
In Michigan, Steyer has sought to cast Republican Senate candidate Terri Lynn Land as beholden to the oil industry and the Kochs. Americans for Prosperity has spent more than $2.5 million on television ads boosting Land.
Land spokeswoman Heather Swift called Steyer a "California radical billionaire environmentalist" who is "trying to buy the Michigan Senate race" for Democrat Gary Peters.
During his interactions in Detroit, Steyer talked little about the Senate race itself.
Meeting with Griswold and other neighborhood residents, Steyer appeared energized, complimenting one activist on her jaunty straw fedora and promising to look for a way to help them better monitor air quality from the refinery and other heavy industry in the neighborhood.
(Jamal Kheiry, a spokesman for refinery owner Marathon Petroleum, said the plant "continuously" monitors air quality and consistently meets standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency.)
Urged on by one of the activists, Steyer joined the group in a prayer circle, closing his eyes and locking arms tightly with neighborhood resident Andre Driscoll and NextGen's  political director, Sky Gallegos.
He insists that the midterm elections are just the start of his mission. "We are going to end up with a bunch of e-mail addresses attached to names and people who say they are committed climate voters," he said in the interview. The goal is to keep the conversation alive after Election Day.
Steyer, 57, dismisses speculation he is laying the foundation for elective office -- perhaps a run for California governor. But he doesn't rule out the possibility, either. "If I thought there was a real reason to run that would move the ball forward, I would do it," he said. "But that's not what we are doing now. ... I'm not doing this as a pretext for something else."
CHARGES OF HYPOCRISY
Before launching NextGen, Steyer was best known in politics for his work on California ballot initiatives. In 2010, he donated $5million to successfully oppose a measure that would have weakened California's carbon emissions standards. He spent more than $30 million on a winning campaign for an initiative that raised corporate taxes and redirected a big share of the money to clean-energy projects.
He reached a turning point in 2012 when he decided to devote his time to climate change activism and emerged as one of the nation's most vocal opponents to the Keystone XL pipeline that would take carbon-heavy oil from the tar sands of Alberta, Canada, to Gulf Coast refineries.
That year, Steyer walked away from Farallon Capital Management, the hedge fund he founded. Farallon, named for a cluster of rocky islands off the Northern California coast, has $20.5 billion in assets under its management.
His critics say Steyer's political activism reeks of hypocrisy, given Farallon's investments in the oil and gas industry -- including coal-fired plants in Asia and Kinder Morgan, a Houston company working to expand its rival pipeline to Keystone XL that will transport oil from the Alberta tar sands to a Pacific port.
"Steyer struck it rich by investing in 'dirty' energy, and then did an about-face when it became politically convenient," Republican Governors Association spokeswoman Gail Gitcho said as the group launched a website labeling him "Steyer the liar." He has faced questions about whether he waited too long to unwind his investments in fossil fuels, a process completed in June.
He called the charges "complete nonsense."
"To leave the job at the end of 2012 and finish divesting, including on a private basis, by June 30, 2014 -- so 18 months -- you may think that's nothing. I think that's lickety-split," he said.
"When I got new information, I changed my mind, which is what we are asking everybody else to do," he said. "Take in the information and change."
Steyer said he expects to be outspent by conservatives. NextGen is not close to raising $50million from other donors, a goal first described in a New York Times story last February, he said. (Steyer insisted that he never set that ambitious target.)
CLIMATE CHANGE RANKS LOW
In Michigan, Peters has held a consistent lead over Land in recent polls. Bill Ballenger,  founder of Inside Michigan Politics,  said Peters' advantage may have less to do with Steyer's activism than the fundamentals of politics in Michigan, a state  where Obama easily won re-election in 2012.
"Most of the state doesn't really know much" about the environmental issues Steyer has highlighted in southwest Detroit, he said.
Polls show global warming is not among the public's top concerns. Climate change ranked  last among 13 issues surveyed in a new Gallup Poll. In all, 40%  of registered voters said it would be an important issue in their midterm voting.
Steyer is undaunted. "It's not clear exactly how we're going to win," he told clean-energy advocates in Detroit, "but it's pretty clear that we have to win."

Warning bells on warming; U.N. panel report: 'Irreversible' climate extremes loom






The United Nations' leading panel on climate change is preparing to warn of "severe, pervasive and irreversible"  extremes if the world doesn't start to corral greenhouse gases causing global warming,  a draft of its report says.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world's top scientific group dedicated to climate, is meeting in Copenhagen this week and will adopt its final report to be released Sunday.
A draft  out this week contains some of the most strident language yet by the panel about climate change.
"Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems," the draft report states. "Human influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic (man-made) emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest in history," the draft says.
The assessment comes as the Earth is on its way to its hottest year ever recorded,  with its highest level of atmospheric carbon dioxide in at least 800,000 years.
Sunday's final report will be "the most comprehensive assessment of climate change ever undertaken," the panel's chairman, Rajendra Pachauri, said Monday.
Jessica Hellmann, associate professor of biological sciences at the University of Notre Dame, warned about the dire consequences of the findings.
"The report explains that we are approaching a global tipping point," Hellmann said. "If we cross this point, we will see huge changes in ecosystems, our ability to grow food, and increased human suffering from flood, heat, drought and sea level rise." Hellmann added that the world "can still avert catastrophic change if we act quickly to reinvent our economy and our relationship to the Earth, but the window of opportunity is closing."
The report will likely be the primary document used next year in France when world leaders meet to create a binding agreement on climate change.

EPA chief talks economics of cleaner climate; Even doubter states can benefit from alternate energy


Extreme weather events from typhoons to heat waves help make the case to Americans on the need to address climate change, the head of the EPA says, although opposition from congressional Republicans to the Obama administration's ambitious plan remains unrelenting.
"You have fires; you have droughts," Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy said in an interview with Capital Download. "People may not call it climate change," but they feel the consequences from changing weather patterns, including on the economy. "This is about their own jobs, their own health, their own kids."
She says the response in states, including some led by skeptical Republican governors, bolsters the argument that dealing with climate change can carry economic benefits. Opponents warn that the administration's proposed limits on carbon emissions in power plants will cost jobs and hurt workers.
"Look at Iowa," McCarthy told USA TODAY's weekly newsmaker series. "Who's larger in wind industry than Iowa is? That governor is not embracing climate change. He's embracing the economy. If they collide with one another in a happy way, why wouldn't we take advantage of that? ... Look at Texas. How hard is this for Texas? They are making huge amounts of money on wind right now, largest ever. So we can make this economic argument just as well as I can make it environmentally."
Texas Gov. Rick Perry has questioned the science behind climate change, and Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad has expressed concerns about the impact of the EPA's proposal.
The administration's Clean Power Plan, unveiled in June and set to take effect next summer, would limit CO2 emissions in power plants.
The EPA issued the proposal after Congress rejected efforts by the Obama administration and congressional Democrats to pass legislation.
This week, a 30-page report issued by the House Energy and Commerce Committee questioned the EPA's authority to impose the emission limits and warned the plan would lead to higher energy prices and fewer jobs. "A runaway regulatory train is barreling toward us, and we must do everything we can to stop it," declared Chairman Fred Upton, R-Mich.
McCarthy responded that she was "very confident that we're going to make our case environmentally and economically," and she dismissed a question about whether incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who accuses the EPA of waging a "war on coal," will be able to slow down the plan's implementation.
"Certainly we'll have as many conversations on the Hill as they want to have, and I have great respect for people's opinions and concerns," she said. "But I feel very strongly that EPA was charged with addressing air pollution and that carbon pollution is no different than any other, no different in our need and authority to address it."
She dodged a question about how the Obama administration would deal with a provision in the appropriations bill passed last week by Congress that bars taxpayer money from going to the U.N. Green Climate Fund. President Obama pledged $3 billion last month to the international effort to help the world's poorest countries address the effects of climate change.
"We'll go back and figure out how to address it," she said.
Over time, she predicted, utility executives and other business leaders who warn of economic catastrophe from the plan will profit from it.
"Every time that EPA has moved forward on a major law, industry or others have raised concerns, some of them in ways that I don't think are really as honest about what the rule looks like," she said. "In the end, when you move, they run, and they make money off it. It's going to be the same here." 




Weak climate deal salvaged at U.N. talks in Peru






Nearly 200 countries salvaged a weak climate agreement Sunday in which each nation pledged to come up with a plan to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.
But, delegates to the United Nations talks delayed decisions on other measures that could have a significant impact on global warming.
The deal -- agreed to 33 hours behind schedule -- barely keeps hope alive for a meaningful global agreement in Paris a year from now. Arguments over the wording of the rulebook for pledges that countries will submit ahead of that meeting took up much of the delegates' time Saturday.
The delegates concluded that a weak deal that avoided pledges on strict emissions reductions was better than no deal at all.
A final draft alleviated concerns by developing nations that the language didn't distinguish what rich and poor countries will be expected to achieve. The final version states nations have "common but differentiated responsibilities" to deal with global warming.
Progress in Lima -- where the conference started Dec. 1 -- was mostly technical, setting out guidelines for financial contributions, actions to reduce emissions and a timetable for the period leading up to the Paris talks.
The U.S. played a more engaged role than in past summits, at one point calling on delegates to approve an early less-than-perfect draft of a Paris text  in order to foster progress in 2015.
"We don't have time for more lengthy negotiations," Stern said. "I believe we will live to regret it if we allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good." Approving language for the 2015 treaty was pushed back to next year.
Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, Peru's environment minister and the conference president, and Christiana Figueres, the U.N.'s top climate official, proclaimed the talks a success.
"A lot of good work was done in Lima," Laurent Fabius, France's foreign minister, said in a briefing. "But it left at least a little work to be done in Paris."
Stern's comments built upon an increasingly strong U.S. stance on climate issues. President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced a bilateral climate agreement at the Group of 20 summit a month ago, and the president promised to provide $3 billion to help poor countries to adapt to climate change this year. Secretary of State John Kerry made an unexpected stop at the Lima talks, which already included an address by former vice president Al Gore.
"The U.S. is now being seen as being credible when it comes to climate change," Laurence Tubiana, the French diplomat who will preside over next year's conference in Paris, said. "For the world, it is a welcome development."

Natural weather patterns, not man-made global warming, are causing the historic drought in California, says a study out Monday from federal scientists.
"It's important to note that California's drought, while extreme, is not an uncommon occurrence," said Richard Seager, the report's lead author and professor with Columbia University's Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory. The report was sponsored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
"In fact, multiyear droughts appear regularly in the state's climate record," he said.
The persistent weather pattern over the past several years has featured a warm, dry ridge of high pressure over the eastern north Pacific Ocean and western North America. Such high-pressure ridges prevent clouds from forming and precipitation from falling.
The study notes that this ridge -- which has resulted in decreased rain and snowfall since 2011 -- is almost opposite to what computer models predict would result from human-caused climate change.
The  report says midwinter precipitation is projected to rise because of human-caused climate change. Seager said a low-pressure system, which creates clouds and precipitation, would probably form off the California coast because of climate change.
Some outside climate scientists criticized the report, saying it didn't take into effect how record warmth worsened the drought. "The authors of the new report would really have us believe that is merely a coincidence and has nothing to do with the impact of human-caused climate change?" Penn State meteorologist Michael Mann wrote Monday in The Huffington Post.
Mann said the NOAA report focuses primarily on the lack of precipitation, not the unusually high temperatures  in the oceans and across California.
"This study completely fails to consider what climate change is doing to water," wrote Kevin Trenberth  with the National Center for Atmospheric Research. He said the hotter air increases ground evaporation.
This year, California is having its warmest year in 120 years of weather records, the National Climatic Data Center reported Monday. 




223 firms back EPA power plant rule; Companies sign letter supporting 30% carbon cut


More than 200 U.S. companies came together Tuesday to support a major reduction in carbon pollution from power plants proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency.
"As businesses concerned about the immediate and long-term implications of climate change, we strongly support the principles behind the draft carbon pollution standard for existing power plants," states a letter that was sent to the EPA, the Obama administration and congressional leaders.
Major brand names and Fortune 500 companies -- including Kellogg's, Starbucks, Ikea, Levi Strauss and Nestl� -- were among the 223 companies that signed the letter.
The proposed EPA rule aims to reduce carbon pollution from the nation's power plants by 30% from 2005 levels. It represents one of the most significant actions ever taken by the U.S. government to fight climate change. The public comment period for the plan ended Monday, and the EPA should announce a final rule next summer.
Carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels is the greenhouse gas that's most responsible for global warming, according to the near-unanimous conclusion of climate scientists.
"Our support is firmly grounded in economic reality," the letter states. "We know that tackling climate change is one of America's greatest economic opportunities of the 21st century, and we applaud the EPA for taking steps to help the country seize that opportunity."
"These companies recognize that the EPA's power plant rule is a critical step in mitigating climate risks and accelerating low-carbon technologies that hold enormous economic promise," said Mindy Lubber, president of the non-profit sustainability group Ceres, which helped organize the letter.
She added that there are some unfounded assumptions that environmental regulations are bad for the economy and bad for jobs, but the facts don't bear that out.
"Achieving the proposed carbon reductions from existing power plants through energy efficiency retrofits of existing buildings will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and our impact on the planet, reduce costs for both power companies and consumers, and help drive the economy by creating jobs," said Dan Probst, Chairman of Energy and Sustainability Services at JLL, a global real estate management and investment firm headquartered in Chicago.
As an example, Probst said that retrofitting of old buildings in Illinois alone should create more than 7,000 jobs.
"We all need to play our part in moving toward a more low-carbon society and economy," said John Gardner, VP and Chief Sustainability Officer at Novelis, the world's largest manufacturer of rolled aluminum.
"It's a win economically and win environmentally," he said.
"Nestl� is 148 years old, and we want to be here for another 148 years," said Tim Brown, president and CEO of Nestl� Waters North America.
"And that's "dependent on a stable environment to operate in."
Other business groups don't see such a rosy picture.
This week, the Competitive Enterprise Institute and 11 other free-market organizations submitted their own public comments to the Environmental Protection Agency, saying the Clean Power Plan would increase electricity prices and raise reliability concerns across the country.
According to CEI senior fellow Marlo Lewis, the Clean Power Plan is illegitimate and unlawful: "The plan's putative climate benefits are illusory -- the regulation should be withdrawn." 




GOP battles await Obama's return; Republicans ready to fight 'tooth and nail' on immigration, Iran


President Obama, who has made aggressive moves since Democratic losses on Election Day, faces more battles with newly empowered Republicans after he returns from his foreign trip Sunday.
In the wake of recent announcements about climate change and Internet policy -- both of which drew criticism from the GOP -- Obama faces contentious calls over immigration and Iran.
Obama and congressional Republicans will also fight over the Keystone XL oil pipeline and a new spending plan designed to take effect when the current one expires Dec.11.
While Republicans won control of the Senate and expanded their House majority in the Nov.4 elections, Obama vowed to avoid claims he has become a lame duck.
"The president has indicated that he's going to use all of the authority that's vested in the executive branch of the United States to take action that would benefit the American people," said White House spokesman Josh Earnest.
While traveling this past week to economic conferences in China, Burma and Australia, Obama made clear he plans to take action on the most contentious issue of all: immigration.
The president, who left Australia early Sunday for the return flight to Washington, plans to meet with advisers in the coming days on the details of new immigration executive orders that could grant legal status to millions of undocumented immigrants. A formal announcement could come anytime over the next several weeks.
Congressional Republicans said Obama's "executive amnesty plan" would poison relations on immigration and a variety of other issues.
"We're going to fight the president tooth and nail if he continues down this path," said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. "This is the wrong way to govern. This is exactly what the American people said on Election Day they didn't want."
Some Republicans have suggested they may block approval of a new spending plan if Obama goes forward with his immigration orders. That sets up the possibility of a government shutdown when the current one expires Dec. 11.
The Obama administration's negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program could also produce a flashpoint with Republicans. The U.S., its allies and Iran face a Nov. 24 deadline for talks on a deal in which the U.S. coalition would reduce sanctions on Iran if it agrees to forgo the means to make nuclear weapons.
Obama and the Republicans are also on track for a more immediate dispute over the Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry oil from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Republicans have long supported the project, calling it an economic boon. Democrats who had opposed the Keystone project on environmental grounds are now supporting a vote this week. One reason: The fate of pro-Keystone Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., who faces a runoff election for her job Dec. 6. 




China hacks weather network; 4 NOAA websites attacked, important data locked down


China recently hacked into U.S. weather and satellite systems, forcing cybersecurity teams to seal off vital data, officials said Wednesday.
The news came as President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced a climate change agreement in Beijing.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) confirmed the attack but did not indicate the source of the breach. However, the agency told Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., that China was to blame, Wolf's spokesman, Dan Scandling, said.
Wolf, who heads the U.S. House subcommittee that funds NOAA, also scolded the agency for not disclosing the breach to the public.
In recent weeks, four NOAA websites were compromised, spokesman Scott Smullen said. "NOAA staff detected the attacks, and incident response began immediately," he said.
The Washington Post, which first reported the attack, said the initial breach was in September, but government officials gave no indication of the problem until Oct. 20.
The Chinese may not have been trying to acquire specific data in either attack but could have been looking for a way into U.S. computer systems to see how unclassified portions of the U.S. government function, said Edward Ferrara, an analyst with technology research firm Forrester.
Even as Obama shook hands with China's president, an unspoken cyberwar continued to run between the two nations, Ferrara said.
"Functionally, we're in a spirit of d�tente with the Chinese. We're talking with them and trying to cut deals with them, but we're both hitting each other with two-by-fours in the background," he said, adding that the United States maintains the ability to penetrate China's system.
The weather satellite data include forecasts and warnings vital to Americans and the U.S. economy, University of Georgia meteorologist J. Marshall Shepherd said in an e-mail.
"The Chinese hacking of our weather system illustrates that they also understand the value of this data and information," he said. "Every corner of our lives depends on weather information."
NOAA performed unscheduled maintenance to mitigate the attacks, but all services have since been fully restored. The agency wouldn't provide details on what was attacked, whether anything was removed, whether malicious software was let loose in the system or how long the maintenance took after the attack.

Obama clears the air on climate deal with China; Republicans promise to fight 'unrealistic' environmental plan


President Obama served notice Wednesday that he plans to make climate change a  theme of his final two years in office, striking a bilateral deal with China on carbon-reduction emissions after about nine months of secret talks.
The announcement during Obama's trip to Beijing kindled a dispute with some members of the incoming Republican Congress, who said they would resist presidential plans that undercut American industry and cost jobs.
"This unrealistic (China) plan that the president would dump on his successor would ensure higher utility rates and far fewer jobs," said incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
Obama said China's pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will make it easier for other nations to reach a global climate  deal in 2015.
"As the world's two largest economies, energy consumers and emitters of greenhouse gases, we have a special responsibility to lead the global effort against climate change," Obama said.
Under the deal, China would cap its growing carbon emissions by 2030. The U.S. target is to cut its emissions by 26% to 28% of 2005 levels by the year 2025.
A report released last month by the environmental group Greenpeace showed that China's coal consumption  dropped by 1%-2% over the first nine months of this year compared with 2013. That compares with 5%-10% annual increases last decade.
The use of coal to generate U.S. power has declined as  utilities have shifted to cheaper natural gas, according to the International Energy Agency.
In late October, Obama dispatched a special negotiator to China: senior adviser John Podesta, who was brought into the administration largely to handle environmental issues.
American and Chinese negotiators met last week before Obama's visit to Beijing for an Asian economic summit.
In the days leading up to Obama's arrival Sunday, the Chinese government shut down factories in and around Beijing to improve the air quality.
Congress cannot ratify or reject the deal with China. Republicans can try to minimize its impact by legislating away industry regulations. McConnell said Congress would work on "easing the burden already created" by Environmental Protection Agency regulations.
House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, who will have a bigger GOP majority in the wake of last week's elections, said the China announcement "is yet another sign that the president intends to double down on his job-crushing policies no matter how devastating the impact for America's heartland and the country as a whole."
Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., soon-to-be chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, called the agreement "a non-binding charade."
Given the GOP majority in both the Senate and House, Obama has no hope of getting a climate bill passed. He could issue executive actions that deal with such items as coal ash and emissions at future power plants.
In announcing Wednesday's deal with China, Obama said new climate change rules, combined with development of clean energy sources, will improve public health, grow the economy, create jobs and "put both of our nations on the path to a low-carbon economy." 


taking a page from the Clinton playbook. There is nothing binding about President Xi's agreement, and China will face zero consequences if it does not live up to its word.
And we should have no such expectation. This is a non-binding charade because as China's economy grows, so will its demand for electricity. China is the largest consumer and importer of coal in the world, accounting for 50% of global consumption.
Over the next decade, China is expected to bring a new coal-fired power plant online every 10 days to give its hungry economy the electricity it demands, according to the Energy Information Administration.
Unlike the United States, China does not have other inexpensive energy resources. China has not had a shale revolution, and it has no known natural gas reserves.
To continue to support the world's largest economy, China will have no choice but to break its promise of hitting its emissions peak by 2030.
Meanwhile, President Obama's agreement binds the U.S. to immediate action, which he will pursue through regulations and mandates.
The climate rules his administration is already developing for power plants go beyond the scope of the Clean Air Act, and the cost to implement just one of these rules is expected to total  $479 billion from 2017 through 2031.
While China continues to lure manufacturing and agriculture jobs away from our shores with promises of cheap labor and abundant electricity, these overbearing regulations will only move the needle by 0.018 degrees Celsius by 2100.
As Republicans take the majority in the new Congress, I will be working to ensure these rules do not become final or put at risk our economy and domestic energy expansion.
Sen. James M. Inhofe, R-Okla., is expected to become chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in the new Congress. 



U.S.-China climate accord offers new hope for
Global warming is, by definition, a global problem that requires a global solution. But two countries count more than all the rest: China and the United States.
Together, they produce almost 40% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. That's why Wednesday's announcement in Beijing of a deal to limit those emissions is such an important step toward averting catastrophic disruption of the Earth's climate.
Until now, China and the U.S. have been locked in a "you go first" standoff. China has resisted limits because the U.S. and other nations had a decades-long head start on industrialization. The U.S has been reluctant to act only to see increases from China swamp any U.S. reductions.
Wednesday's unexpectedly detailed agreement points to a way out. President Obama set a new target to cut U.S. carbon pollution 26%-28% from 2005 levels by 2025. And Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged -- for the first time -- to cap his nation's carbon emissions by 2030 and sharply increase its share of non-fossil fuel energy.
Xi's pledge wasn't prompted by a sudden concern about the fate of polar bears. China is doing something it has powerful domestic incentives to do anyway. Coal burned in power plants and factories is a main source of the smog that shrouds Beijing and other cities, threatening public health and inviting social unrest. (In a vivid display of how human activity can alter the atmosphere, the skies were much clearer in Beijing during this week's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit after  plants were shut down and traffic was limited.)
As critics were quick to point out, Wednesday's deal won't solve climate change.
China's emissions could keep rising for 16 more years before they peak. And the U.S. goal is less ambitious than it seems,  because emissions have already been dropping since the mid-2000s as natural gas displaces dirtier coal.
Despite these caveats, the agreement  is a big deal. Scientists say that while it might not keep the globe from warming beyond the global target of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, it could prevent a ruinous 7.2 degree-F rise.
The agreement also will give a big boost to United Nations climate talks next month in Peru and next year in France. With China (24% of global greenhouse gases) and the U.S. (15%) on board, it will be easier to bring along other big emitters, such as the European Union (10%) and India (6%).
None of this seems to matter to Congress' head-in-the-sand crowd, which promptly denounced the Beijing deal and has blocked the best way to cut emissions: Put a price on carbon to prevent polluters from treating the atmosphere as a waste dump.
In the new Republican-controlled Senate, coal champion Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the incoming majority leader, and climate change skeptic James Inhofe of Oklahoma, the presumed new chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee,  vow to stop Obama's efforts to regulate emissions.
The objections from McConnell, Inhofe and others boil down to this: China should do  more to curb its emissions. The U.S. shouldn't do anything. It's hard to see that approach flying in Beijing, or any other world capital. 




China, U.S. set climate target; Obama looks to cut emissions up to 28% by 2025


China and the United States took joint aim at global warming today, revealing fresh efforts to cut greenhouse gases.
President Obama put the United States on a faster track in cutting pollution, setting a goal of reducing emissions 26% to 28% by 2025, compared with 2005 levels. The current goal was to cut emissions by 17% by 2020.
Chinese President Xi Jinping elected to set a target for China's emissions to peak by 2030, without setting specific goals.
News of the greenhouse gas development came after Obama told Xi on Tuesday that he wants to take U.S.-China relations to "a new level." That comment followed a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders who agreed to study a Chinese-backed free-trade pact that reveals Beijing's ambition to shape global commerce.
The United States pushes a rival deal that excludes China.
China last hosted the annual summit of leaders from the 21-member Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in 2001. The past 13 years have seen the country's GDP almost quadruple to $10 trillion. China seeks to set the rules in a U.S.-dominated world trading system.
The APEC leaders agreed to launch a two-year study of the Free-Trade Area of the Asia Pacific. "This is a historic step in the direction of an Asia-Pacific free-trade area," Xi said at a news conference where, typically for China, no questions could be asked.
Washington prefers the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which includes 12 countries -- but not China.Obama met with leaders of those countries Monday and reported progress toward a deal but no early time frame for completion. 




Climate change efforts take root






Some communities in Minnesota are already making efforts to adapt to climate change through moves designed to limit greenhouse gas emissions.
The Water Resources Center at the University of Minnesota held a conference Thursday to foster a discussion among government officials, academics and others. Participants planned to brainstorm ways the state can adapt to climate change, including the creation of a greater capacity for stormwater and cooling zones for heat waves.
"It took a long time for enough people to understand that there really was an issue," WRC interim director Faye Sleeper said of global climate change.
Experts have noted increased temperatures and more frequent big rain events in Minnesota, according to Minnesota Public Radio News. Climate scientists expect those trends to continue.
Some cities are combating changes by using precipitation data to ensure roads and stormwater systems are prepared to handle heavier rainfall.
Some forest managers are looking into tree species that are more resilient when the climate changes.
Although farmers have a history of responding to year-to-year weather changes, some are now advocating a more diverse agricultural landscape. That's one of the best ways to respond to a changing climate, according to UM researcher Nick Jordan. Experts need to determine which crops best benefit soil by boosting organic material, while also allowing farmers to make money, he said.
"We have not had a business model to really move that kind of climate-smart agriculture forward," Jordan said.
Homeowners can also make changes that will help them and the environment, according to Paul Moss, who oversees climate adaptation efforts at the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.
"For example, look at planting trees near your home," Moss said. "Trees can help cool your home when we're having hot weather. Also, trees can help intercept heavy precipitation and break the fall of the rain as well as absorb and purify the rain." 


A new United Nations report finds with at least 95% certainty that humans and greenhouse gas emissions are largely to blame for climate change.
You can kill the messenger all you want, but you can't discredit the message.
It's tough sacrificing some short-term comfort (and profits) for longer-term environmental sustainability, but we are stewards for future generations.
I'd hate to know how future generations will judge us if skeptics continue to obstruct needed change.

Science shouldn't be a liberal vs. conservative issue. I would expect arguments about what to do about climate change, with liberals emphasizing a more active role for government and conservatives emphasizing the abilities of private industry to come to the rescue.
Unfortunately, primarily in the United States, climate change has become a political issue to the point where the right denies it despite evidence.

The cause of climate change has little to do with what should be done. The real question is do we want it to happen, and if not, what do we do about it? Many undesirable things occur that aren't man-made (floods, forest fires, shark attacks), but that doesn't mean we don't do anything to try to prevent them or lessen their impact.

Could we all possibly agree that the majority of mankind should show some concern about the only environment we have? This would certainly help foster a more well-rounded approach to conservation, pollution control, population management, toxic waste disposal and deforestation.
We really all might like to continue to enjoy the only planet available to us. What is done today will reap benefits for the future of our world.

While there is a growing, albeit grudging, recognition of potentially devastating long-term consequences of global warming, the response to the issue is underwhelming. Why?
Is it because warming cannot be halted? Is it because the change is a natural phenomena and only partially man-made? Maybe.  But the most critical reason is a potent cognitive bias that allows humans to severely discount vague, unknown and seemingly distant consequences against present circumstances. We simply are not well-equipped to consider future consequences, no matter how existentially dangerous they might be, and give them equal footing with more present concerns.
Call it a human frailty. I call it human nature. Until a crisis is upon us, attitudes are unlikely to change.
